  Homer

BOOK  

Tell  ,   muse,     ingenious hero   travelled far   wide
after   had sacked   famous town   Troy. Many cities did   visit,
  many were   nations   whose manners   customs   was acquainted;
moreover   suffered much   sea while trying   save   own life
  bring   men safely home; but       might   could   save
  men,     perished through   own sheer folly   eating
  cattle     Sun god Hyperion;     god prevented them  
ever reaching home. Tell  , too,     these things,   daughter
  Jove,   whatsoever source   may know them. 

  now     escaped death   battle     shipwreck had got safely
home except Ulysses,    , though   was longing   return    
wife   country, was detained     goddess Calypso,   had got
him into   large cave   wanted   marry him. But   years went  ,
  came   time when   gods settled     should   back  
Ithaca; even then, however, when   was among   own people,  
troubles were   yet over; nevertheless     gods had now begun
  pity him except Neptune,   still persecuted him without ceasing
      let him   home. 

Now Neptune had gone off     Ethiopians,   are     world  
end,   lie   two halves,     looking West     other East.
  had gone     accept   hecatomb   sheep   oxen,   was
enjoying himself     festival; but   other gods met     house
  Olympian Jove,     sire   gods   men spoke first.    
moment   was thinking   Aegisthus,   had been killed   Agamemnon  
son Orestes;     said     other gods: 

"See now, how men lay blame upon us gods     is after   nothing
but   own folly. Look   Aegisthus;   must needs make love  
Agamemnon   wife unrighteously   then kill Agamemnon, though  
knew         death   him;     sent Mercury   warn him
      either   these things, inasmuch   Orestes     sure
  take   revenge when   grew     wanted   return home. Mercury
told him       good   but       listen,   now  
has paid   everything   full." 

Then Minerva said, "Father, son   Saturn, King   kings,   served
Aegisthus right,         any   else   does     did;
but Aegisthus is neither here nor  ;   is   Ulysses    
heart bleeds, when   think     sufferings     lonely sea girt
island, far away, poor man,       friends.   is   island
covered   forest,     very middle     sea,     goddess
lives  , daughter     magician Atlas,   looks after   bottom
    ocean,   carries   great columns   keep heaven   earth
asunder.   daughter   Atlas has got hold   poor unhappy Ulysses,
  keeps trying   every kind   blandishment   make him forget
  home,       is tired   life,   thinks   nothing but how
  may once more see   smoke     own chimneys.  , sir, take
no heed    ,   yet when Ulysses was before Troy did     propitiate
    many   burnt sacrifice? Why then should   keep   being
  angry   him?" 

  Jove said, "  child,   are   talking  ? How can   forget
Ulysses than whom   is no more capable man   earth, nor more
liberal     offerings     immortal gods   live   heaven?
Bear   mind, however,   Neptune is still furious   Ulysses
  having blinded   eye   Polyphemus king     Cyclopes. Polyphemus
is son   Neptune     nymph Thoosa, daughter     sea king Phorcys;
therefore though       kill Ulysses outright,   torments him
  preventing him   getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together
  see how   can help him   return; Neptune   then   pacified,
      are       mind   can hardly stand   against us."

  Minerva said, "Father, son   Saturn, King   kings,  , then,
  gods now mean   Ulysses should   home,   should first send
Mercury     Ogygian island   tell Calypso       made  
our minds       is   return.     meantime         Ithaca,
  put heart into Ulysses' son Telemachus;     embolden him  
call   Achaeans   assembly,   speak       suitors    
mother Penelope,   persist   eating   any number     sheep
  oxen;     also conduct him   Sparta     Pylos,   see  
  can hear anything     return     dear father-    
  make people speak well   him." 

  saying she bound     glittering golden sandals, imperishable,
    she can fly like   wind over land   sea; she grasped
  redoubtable bronze shod spear,   stout   sturdy   strong,
wherewith she quells   ranks   heroes     displeased  ,
  down she darted     topmost summits   Olympus, whereon forthwith
she was   Ithaca,     gateway   Ulysses' house, disguised  
  visitor, Mentes, chief     Taphians,   she held   bronze spear
    hand.   she found   lordly suitors seated   hides  
  oxen     had killed   eaten,   playing draughts  
front     house. Men servants   pages were bustling    
wait upon them, some mixing wine   water     mixing bowls, some
cleaning down   tables   wet sponges   laying them   again,
  some cutting   great quantities   meat. 

Telemachus saw   long before any   else did.   was sitting moodily
among   suitors thinking     brave father,   how    
send them flying       house,     were   come     own again
    honoured     days gone  . Thus brooding     sat among
them,   caught sight   Minerva   went straight     gate,  
  was vexed     stranger should   kept waiting   admittance.
  took   right hand     own,   bade   give him   spear.
"Welcome," said  , "  our house,   when     partaken   food
  shall tell us       come  ." 

  led   way     spoke,   Minerva followed him. When   were
within   took   spear   set       spear- stand against  
strong bearing post along     many other spears     unhappy
father,     conducted       richly decorated seat under  
  threw   cloth   damask.   was   footstool also     feet,
    set another seat near     himself, away     suitors,
  she might     annoyed while eating     noise   insolence,
      might ask   more freely     father. 

  maid servant then brought them water     beautiful golden ewer
  poured   into   silver basin   them   wash   hands,  
she drew   clean table beside them.   upper servant brought them
bread,   offered them many good things       was    
house,   carver fetched them plates     manner   meats   set
cups   gold     side,     man servant brought them wine  
poured       them. 

Then   suitors came     took   places     benches  
seats. Forthwith men servants poured water over   hands, maids
went round     bread baskets, pages filled   mixing bowls  
wine   water,     laid   hands upon   good things  
were before them.   soon     had had enough   eat   drink
  wanted music   dancing,   are   crowning embellishments
    banquet,     servant brought   lyre   Phemius, whom   compelled
perforce   sing   them.   soon     touched   lyre   began
  sing Telemachus spoke low   Minerva,     head close   hers
  no man might hear. 

"  hope, sir," said  , "          offended      
am going    . Singing comes cheap   those       pay    ,
      is done     cost     whose bones lie rotting  
some wilderness   grinding   powder     surf.   these men were
  see   father come back   Ithaca     pray   longer legs
rather than   longer purse,   money     serve them; but  ,
alas, has fallen     ill fate,   even when people   sometimes
      is coming,   no longer heed them;   shall never see
him again.   now, sir, tell     tell   true,     are  
where   come  . Tell     your town   parents,   manner
  ship   came  , how your crew brought     Ithaca,      
nation   declared themselves    -     cannot   come  
land. Tell   also truly,     want   know, are     stranger  
  house,       been here     father   time?     old
days   had many visitors     father went   much himself."

  Minerva answered, "    tell   truly   particularly  
   .   am Mentes, son   Anchialus,     am King     Taphians.
    come here     ship   crew,     voyage   men     foreign
tongue being bound   Temesa     cargo   iron,     shall bring
back copper.       ship,   lies over yonder off   open country
away     town,     harbour Rheithron under   wooded mountain
Neritum. Our fathers were friends before us,   old Laertes   tell
 ,           ask him.    , however,     never
comes   town now,   lives   himself     country, faring hardly,
    old woman   look after him       dinner   him, when
  comes   tired   pottering     vineyard.   told  
your father was   home again,     was why   came, but   seems
  gods are still keeping him back,     is   dead yet    
  mainland.   is more likely   is   some sea girt island   mid
ocean,     prisoner among savages   are detaining him against  
    am no prophet,   know very little   omens, but   speak
    is borne   upon     heaven,   assure        
    away much longer;     is   man   such resource   even
though   were   chains   iron     find some means   getting
home again. But tell  ,   tell   true, can Ulysses really  
such   fine looking fellow     son?   are indeed wonderfully like
him     head   eyes,     were close friends before   set
sail   Troy where   flower       Argives went also. Since
  time     never either   us seen   other." 

"  mother," answered Telemachus, tells     am son   Ulysses, but
  is   wise child   knows   own father.       were son
      had grown old upon   own estates,  , since   ask
 ,   is no more ill starred man under heaven than      
tell   is   father." 

  Minerva said, "  is no fear   your race dying   yet, while
Penelope has such   fine son     are. But tell  ,   tell  
true,   is   meaning       feasting,     are these
people?   is      ?     some banquet,   is    
wedding     family-   no   seems     bringing any provisions
    own?     guests- how atrociously   are behaving;  
riot   make over   whole house;   is enough   disgust any respectable
person   comes near them." 

"Sir," said Telemachus, "  regards your question,   long     father
was here   was well   us       house, but   gods    
displeasure   willed   otherwise,     hidden him away more
closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden.   could   borne  
better even though   were dead,     had fallen     men before
Troy,   had died   friends around him when   days     fighting
were done;   then   Achaeans     built   mound over  
ashes,     should myself   been heir     renown; but now  
storm winds   spirited him away   know   wither;   is gone
without leaving   much     trace behind him,     inherit nothing
but dismay. Nor does   matter end simply   grief     loss
    father; heaven has laid sorrows upon     yet another kind;
    chiefs     our islands, Dulichium, Same,     woodland
island   Zacynthus,   also     principal men   Ithaca itself,
are eating     house under   pretext   paying   court  
  mother,     neither point blank     she     marry,
nor yet bring matters     end;     are making havoc     estate,
  before long       also   myself." 

"Is    ?" exclaimed Minerva, "then     indeed want Ulysses
home again. Give him   helmet, shield,     couple lances,  
    is   man   was when   first knew him   our house, drinking
  making merry,     soon lay   hands   these rascally
suitors, were     stand once more upon   own threshold.   was
then coming   Ephyra, where   had been   beg poison     arrows
  Ilus, son   Mermerus. Ilus feared   ever living gods    
  give him any, but   father let him   some,     was very
fond   him.   Ulysses is   man   then was these suitors  
    short shrift     sorry wedding. 

"But  !   rests   heaven   determine whether   is   return,
  take   revenge     own house   no;    , however, urge
    set   trying     rid   these suitors   once. Take
  advice, call   Achaean heroes   assembly   morrow -lay your
case before them,   call heaven   bear   witness. Bid   suitors
take themselves off, each     own place,     your mother   mind
is set   marrying again, let     back     father,    
find     husband   provide         marriage gifts  
  dear   daughter may expect.     yourself, let   prevail upon
    take   best ship   can  ,     crew   twenty men,
      quest   your father   has   long been missing. Some
  may tell   something,   (  people often hear things    
way) some heaven sent message may direct  . First     Pylos  
ask Nestor; thence       Sparta   visit Menelaus,     got
home last       Achaeans;     hear   your father is alive
      way home,   can put       waste these suitors  
make   yet another twelve months.       other hand   hear
    death, come home   once, celebrate   funeral rites  
  due pomp, build   barrow     memory,   make your mother marry
again. Then, having done    , think   well over   your mind
how,   fair means   foul,   may kill these suitors   your own
house.   are too old   plead infancy any longer;       heard
how people are singing Orestes' praises   having killed   father  
murderer Aegisthus?   are   fine, smart looking fellow; show your
mettle, then,   make yourself   name   story. Now, however,   must
  back     ship       crew,       impatient     keep
them waiting longer; think   matter over   yourself,   remember
      said    ." 

"Sir," answered Telemachus, "  has been very kind       talk
        way,   though   were your own son,          
  tell  ;   know   want     getting     your voyage, but
stay   little longer till     taken   bath   refreshed yourself.
    then give     present,     shall     your way rejoicing;
    give       great beauty   value-   keepsake such  
only dear friends give     another." 

Minerva answered, "    try   keep  ,             way
  once.     any present   may   disposed   make  , keep  
till   come again,       take   home    .   shall give
    very good  ,       give       no less value   return."

  these words she flew away like   bird into   air, but she had
given Telemachus courage,   had made him think more than ever  
  father.   felt   change, wondered    ,   knew    
stranger had been   god,     went straight   where   suitors
were sitting. 

Phemius was still singing,     hearers sat rapt   silence  
  told   sad tale     return   Troy,     ills Minerva
had laid upon   Achaeans. Penelope, daughter   Icarius, heard  
song     room upstairs,   came down     great staircase,
  alone, but attended   two     handmaids. When she reached
  suitors she stood         bearing posts   supported  
roof     cloisters     staid maiden   either side    . She
held   veil, moreover, before   face,   was weeping bitterly.

"Phemius," she cried, "  know many another feat   gods   heroes,
such   poets love   celebrate. Sing   suitors some     these,
  let them drink   wine   silence, but cease   sad tale,
    breaks   sorrowful heart,   reminds       lost husband
whom   mourn ever without ceasing,   whose name was great over  
Hellas   middle Argos." 

"Mother," answered Telemachus, "let   bard sing     has   mind
 ; bards     make   ills   sing  ;   is Jove,    ,
  makes them,     sends weal   woe upon mankind according  
  own good pleasure.   fellow means no harm   singing   ill fated
return     Danaans,   people always applaud   latest songs
most warmly. Make   your mind       bear  ; Ulysses is    
only man   never came back   Troy, but many another went down
  well    .  , then, within   house   busy yourself   your
daily duties, your loom, your distaff,     ordering   your servants;
  speech is man   matter,   mine above   others-     is  
  am master here." 

She went wondering back into   house,   laid   son   saying
    heart. Then, going upstairs     handmaids into   room,
she mourned   dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over  
eyes. But   suitors were clamorous throughout   covered cloisters,
  prayed each       might     bed fellow. 

Then Telemachus spoke, "Shameless,"   cried, "  insolent suitors,
let us feast   our pleasure now,   let     no brawling,  
  is   rare thing   hear   man   such   divine voice   Phemius
has; but     morning meet     full assembly     may give  
formal notice   depart,   feast     another   houses, turn  
turn  ,   your own cost.       other hand   choose   persist
  spunging upon   man, heaven help  , but Jove shall reckon  
    full,   when   fall     father   house   shall  
no man   avenge  ." 

  suitors bit   lips     heard him,   marvelled    
boldness     speech. Then, Antinous, son   Eupeithes, said, " 
gods seem     given   lessons   bluster   tall talking; may
Jove never grant       chief   Ithaca   your father was before
 ." 

Telemachus answered, "Antinous,     chide    , but, god willing,
      chief too     can. Is     worst fate   can think
     ?   is no bad thing       chief,     brings both riches
  honour. Still, now   Ulysses is dead   are many great men
  Ithaca both old   young,   some other may take   lead among
them; nevertheless       chief     own house,     rule
those whom Ulysses has won    ." 

Then Eurymachus, son   Polybus, answered, "  rests   heaven  
decide   shall   chief among us, but   shall   master   your
own house   over your own possessions; no   while   is   man
  Ithaca shall     violence nor rob  .   now,   good fellow,
  want   know     stranger.   country does   come  ?
    family is  ,   where is   estate? Has   brought  
news     return   your father,   was     business    
own?   seemed   well     man, but   hurried off   suddenly  
  was gone     moment before   could     know him."

"  father is dead   gone," answered Telemachus, "  even   some
rumour reaches     put no more faith     now.   mother does indeed
sometimes send     soothsayer   question him, but   give   prophecyings
no heed.       stranger,   was Mentes, son   Anchialus, chief
    Taphians,   old friend     father  ." But     heart  
knew     had been   goddess. 

  suitors then returned     singing   dancing until   evening;
but when night fell upon   pleasuring   went home   bed each
    own abode. Telemachus   room was high       tower   looked
      outer court; hither, then,   hied, brooding   full  
thought.   good old woman, Euryclea, daughter   Ops,   son   Pisenor,
went before him     couple   blazing torches. Laertes had bought
      own money when she was quite young;   gave   worth
  twenty oxen    ,   shewed   much respect         household
    did     own wedded wife, but   did   take       bed
    feared   wife   resentment. She   was   now lighted Telemachus
    room,   she loved him better than any     other women
    house did,   she had nursed him when   was   baby.   opened
  door     bed room   sat down upon   bed;     took off
  shirt   gave       good old woman,   folded   tidily  ,
  hung     him over   peg     bed side, after   she went
 , pulled   door       silver catch,   drew   bolt home
  means     strap. But Telemachus     lay covered     woollen
fleece kept thinking   night through     intended voyage    
counsel   Minerva had given him.

BOOK II

Now when   child   morning, rosy fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus
rose   dressed himself.   bound   sandals       comely feet,
girded   sword     shoulder,   left   room looking like
  immortal god.     once sent   criers round   call   people
  assembly,     called them     people gathered thereon;
then, when   were got together,   went     place   assembly
spear   hand-   alone,     two hounds went   him. Minerva
endowed him     presence   such divine comeliness     marvelled
  him     went  ,   when   took   place'     father  
seat even   oldest councillors made way   him. 

Aegyptius,   man bent double   age,     infinite experience,
  first   speak   son Antiphus had gone   Ulysses   Ilius,
land   noble steeds, but   savage Cyclops had killed him when  
were   shut       cave,   had cooked   last dinner   him,
  had three sons left,   whom two still worked     father  
land, while   third, Eurynomus, was       suitors; nevertheless
  father could     over   loss   Antiphus,   was still
weeping   him when   began   speech. 

"Men   Ithaca,"   said, "hear   words.     day Ulysses left
us   has been no meeting   our councillors until now;   then
can    , whether old   young,   finds     necessary   convene
us? Has   got wind   some host approaching,   does   wish  
warn us,       speak upon some other matter   public moment?
  am sure   is   excellent person,     hope Jove   grant him
  heart   desire." 

Telemachus took   speech     good omen   rose   once,  
  was bursting       had    .   stood     middle  
  assembly     good herald Pisenor brought him   staff. Then,
turning   Aegyptius, "Sir," said  , "  is  ,       shortly
learn,     convened  ,     is     am   most aggrieved.
      got wind   any host approaching         warn
 , nor is   any matter   public moment         speak.
  grieveance is purely personal,   turns   two great misfortunes
    fallen upon   house.   first   these is   loss  
  excellent father,   was chief among     here present,  
was like   father   every      ;   second is much more serious,
  ere long       utter ruin     estate.   sons    
  chief men among   are pestering   mother   marry them against
   .   are afraid         father Icarius, asking him
  choose       likes best,     provide marriage gifts  
  daughter, but day   day   keep hanging     father   house,
sacrificing our oxen, sheep,   fat goats     banquets,  
never giving   much     thought     quantity   wine   drink.
No estate can stand such recklessness;     now no Ulysses   ward
off harm   our doors,     cannot hold   own against them.  
shall never     days     good   man     was, still    
indeed defend myself     had power      ,     cannot stand such
treatment any longer;   house is being disgraced   ruined.  
respect, therefore,   your own consciences     public opinion.
Fear, too,   wrath   heaven, lest   gods should   displeased
  turn upon  .   pray     Jove   Themis,   is   beginning
    end   councils, [   ] hold back,   friends,   leave
  singlehanded- unless         brave father Ulysses did some
wrong     Achaeans       now avenge    ,   aiding
  abetting these suitors. Moreover,     am     eaten     house
  home    ,   had rather   did   eating yourselves,    
could then take action against     some purpose,   serve  
  notices   house   house till   got paid   full, whereas
now     no remedy." 

    Telemachus dashed   staff     ground   burst into
tears. Every   was very sorry   him, but     sat still  
no   ventured   make him   angry answer, save only Antinous,  
spoke thus: 

"Telemachus, insolent braggart     are, how dare   try   throw
  blame upon us suitors?   is your mother   fault   ours,  
she is   very artful woman.   three years past,   close   four,
she has been driving us     our minds,   encouraging each  
  us,   sending him messages without meaning   word     she
says.   then   was   other trick she played us. She set  
  great tambour frame     room,   began   work     enormous
piece   fine needlework. 'Sweet hearts,' said she, 'Ulysses is indeed
dead, still     press     marry again immediately, wait-  
        skill   needlework perish unrecorded- till    
completed   pall     hero Laertes,       readiness against
  time when death shall take him.   is very rich,     women
    place   talk     is laid   without   pall.'

"  was   she said,     assented; whereon   could see  
working     great web   day long, but   night she   unpick
  stitches again   torchlight. She fooled us     way   three
years     never found    , but   time wore     she was
now     fourth year,       maids   knew   she was doing
told us,     caught       act   undoing   work,   she
had   finish   whether she     no.   suitors, therefore,
make     answer,   both       Achaeans may understand-'Send
your mother away,   bid   marry   man     own      
father   choice';         know     happen   she goes  
plaguing us much longer     airs she gives herself     score
    accomplishments Minerva has taught  ,   because she is
  clever.   never yet heard   such   woman;   know     Tyro,
Alcmena, Mycene,     famous women   old, but   were nothing
  your mother, any     them.   was   fair       treat us
    way,     long   she continues     mind     heaven
has now endowed  ,   long shall       eating   your estate;
        see why she should change,   she gets     honour
  glory,     is     pay    ,   she. Understand, then,
          back   our lands, neither here nor elsewhere,
till she has made   choice   married some     other   us."

Telemachus answered, "Antinous, how can   drive   mother   bore
      father   house?   father is abroad         know
whether   is alive   dead.       hard             pay
Icarius   large sum     must give him     insist   sending
  daughter back   him.   only     deal rigorously    ,
but heaven   also punish  ;     mother when she leaves  
house   calf     Erinyes   avenge  ; besides,      
    creditable thing    ,         nothing        .
    choose   take offence    , leave   house   feast elsewhere
    another   houses   your own cost turn   turn  .  ,
    other hand,   elect   persist   spunging upon   man,
heaven help  , but Jove shall reckon       full,   when  
fall     father   house   shall   no man   avenge  ."

    spoke Jove sent two eagles     top     mountain,  
  flew           wind, sailing side   side     own
lordly flight. When   were right over   middle     assembly
  wheeled   circled  , beating   air     wings  
glaring death into   eyes   them   were below; then, fighting
fiercely   tearing     another,   flew off towards   right
over   town.   people wondered     saw them,   asked each
other       might  ; whereon Halitherses,   was   best
prophet   reader   omens among them, spoke   them plainly  
    honesty, saying: 

"Hear  , men   Ithaca,     speak more particularly     suitors,
    see mischief brewing   them. Ulysses is   going     away
much longer; indeed   is close   hand   deal   death   destruction,
    them alone, but   many another   us   live   Ithaca. Let
us then   wise   time,   put   stop     wickedness before
  comes. Let   suitors         own accord;       better
  them,     am   prophesying without due knowledge; everything
has happened   Ulysses     foretold when   Argives set    
Troy,       them.   said   after going through much hardship
  losing     men   should come home again     twentieth
year     no     know him;   now     is coming true."

Eurymachus son   Polybus then said, "  home, old man,   prophesy
  your own children,     may   worse   them.   can read these
omens myself much better than   can; birds are always flying  
    sunshine somewhere   other, but   seldom mean anything.
Ulysses has died     far country,     is   pity   are   dead
along   him, instead   prating here   omens   adding fuel
    anger   Telemachus   is fierce enough     is.   suppose
  think     give   something   your family, but   tell  -
    shall surely  - when   old man like  ,   should know
better, talks   young   over till   becomes troublesome,    
first place   young friend   only fare   much   worse-  
  take nothing    ,     suitors   prevent  -    
  next,     lay   heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than  
      like paying,       bear hardly upon  .    
Telemachus,   warn him     presence         send   mother
back     father,     find     husband   provide    
    marriage gifts   dear   daughter may expect. Till   shall
    harassing him   our suit;     fear no man,   care neither
  him,       fine speeches, nor   any fortune telling  
yours.   may preach   much     please, but   shall only hate
    more.   shall   back   continue   eat   Telemachus  
estate without paying him, till such time     mother leaves off
tormenting us   keeping us day after day     tiptoe   expectation,
each vying     other     suit     prize   such rare perfection.
Besides   cannot   after   other women whom   should marry  
due course, but     way     she treats us." 

Then Telemachus said, "Eurymachus,     other suitors,   shall
  no more,   entreat   no further,     gods     people
  Ithaca now know   story. Give  , then,   ship     crew   twenty
men   take   hither   thither,           Sparta    
Pylos   quest     father   has   long been missing. Some  
may tell   something,   (  people often hear things     way)
some heaven sent message may direct  .     can hear   him   alive
      way home     put       waste   suitors  
make   yet another twelve months.       other hand   hear  
  death,     return   once, celebrate   funeral rites  
  due pomp, build   barrow     memory,   make   mother marry
again." 

  these words   sat down,   Mentor   had been   friend  
Ulysses,   had been left   charge   everything   full authority
over   servants, rose   speak.  , then, plainly       honesty
addressed them thus: 

"Hear  , men   Ithaca,   hope     may never     kind  
well disposed ruler any more, nor       govern   equitably;
  hope     your chiefs henceforward may   cruel   unjust,
    is         but has forgotten Ulysses,   ruled  
  though   were your father.   am   half   angry     suitors,
      choose     violence     naughtiness     hearts,
  wager   heads   Ulysses     return,   can take
  high hand   eat     estate, but       others   am shocked
    way         sit still without even trying   stop
such scandalous goings       could       chose,    
are many     are few." 

Leiocritus, son   Evenor, answered him saying, "Mentor,   folly
is    ,     should set   people   stay us?   is   hard
thing     man   fight   many     victuals. Even though
Ulysses himself were   set upon us while   are feasting     house,
      best   oust us,   wife,   wants him back   very badly,
    small cause   rejoicing,     blood     upon
  own head     fought against such great odds.   is no sense
        been saying. Now, therefore,     people    
your business,   let   father   old friends, Mentor   Halitherses,
speed   boy     journey,     goes    -         think
   ,     is more likely   stay where   is till some   comes
  tells him something." 

      broke     assembly,   every man went back     own
abode, while   suitors returned     house   Ulysses.

Then Telemachus went   alone     sea side, washed   hands  
  grey waves,   prayed   Minerva. 

"Hear  ,"   cried, "  god   visited   yesterday,   bade  
sail   seas   search     father   has   long been missing.
    obey  , but   Achaeans,   more particularly   wicked
suitors, are hindering       cannot    ." 

    thus prayed, Minerva came close     him     likeness  
    voice   Mentor. "Telemachus," said she, "    are made
    same stuff   your father       neither fool nor coward
henceforward,   Ulysses never broke   word nor left   work half
done.  , then,   take after him, your voyage       fruitless,
but unless       blood   Ulysses     Penelope   your veins
  see no likelihood   your succeeding. Sons are seldom   good men
    fathers;   are generally worse,   better; still,  
  are   going     either fool   coward henceforward,   are
  entirely without some share   your father   wise discernment,
  look   hope upon your undertaking. But mind   never make common
cause   any   those foolish suitors,       neither sense
nor virtue,   give no thought   death       doom    
shortly fall           them,       shall perish  
  same day.     your voyage,   shall     long delayed; your
father was such   old friend   mine       find     ship,
    come     myself. Now, however, return home,      
among   suitors; begin getting provisions ready   your voyage;
see everything well stowed,   wine   jars,     barley meal,
  is   staff   life,   leathern bags, while     round  
town   beat   volunteers   once.   are many ships   Ithaca
both old   new;     run   eye over them         choose
  best;         ready     put     sea without delay."

Thus spoke Minerva daughter   Jove,   Telemachus lost no time  
doing     goddess told him.   went moodily   found   suitors
flaying goats   singeing pigs     outer court. Antinous came
    him   once   laughed     took   hand     own, saying,
"Telemachus,   fine fire eater, bear no more ill blood neither  
word nor deed, but eat   drink   us     used    .   Achaeans
  find     everything-   ship     picked crew   boot-  
    can set sail   Pylos   once     news   your noble
father." 

"Antinous," answered Telemachus, "  cannot eat   peace, nor take
pleasure   any kind   such men     are. Was     enough  
  should waste   much good property   mine while   was yet   boy?
Now     am older   know more    ,   am also stronger,  
whether here among   people,     going   Pylos,        
    harm   can.   shall  ,     going         vain though,
thanks     suitors,     neither ship nor crew     own,  
must   passenger   captain." 

    spoke   snatched   hand       Antinous. Meanwhile
  others went   getting dinner ready     buildings, jeering
  him tauntingly     did  . 

"Telemachus," said   youngster, "means       death   us;  
suppose   thinks   can bring friends   help him   Pylos,  
again   Sparta, where   seems bent   going.          
Ephyra   well,   poison   put   our wine   kill us?"

Another said, "Perhaps   Telemachus goes   board ship,      
like   father   perish far     friends.     case   should
  plenty    ,     could then divide     property amongst
us:       house   can let   mother     man   marries
     ." 

  was how   talked. But Telemachus went down into   lofty
  spacious store room where   father   treasure   gold   bronze
lay heaped   upon   floor,   where   linen   spare clothes
were kept   open chests. Here, too,   was   store   fragrant
olive oil, while casks   old, well ripened wine, unblended   fit
    god   drink, were ranged against   wall   case Ulysses should
come home again after  .   room was closed   well made doors
opening     middle; moreover   faithful old house keeper Euryclea,
daughter   Ops   son   Pisenor, was   charge   everything both
night   day. Telemachus called       store room   said:

"Nurse, draw   off some     best wine    , after    
are keeping     father   own drinking,   case, poor man,   should
escape death,   find   way home again after  . Let     twelve
jars,   see         lids; also fill   some well sewn
leathern bags   barley meal-   twenty measures    .  
these things put together   once,     nothing    .    
take everything away   evening   soon     mother has gone upstairs
    night.   am going   Sparta     Pylos   see     can hear
anything     return     dear father. 

When Euryclea heard   she began   cry,   spoke fondly   him,
saying, "  dear child,   ever can   put such notion    
into your head? Where     world     want      -  ,  
are     hope     house? Your poor father is dead   gone  
some foreign country nobody knows where,     soon   your back
is turned these wicked ones here     scheming       put  
    way,     share   your possessions among themselves;
stay where   are among your own people,         wandering
  worrying your life       barren ocean." 

"Fear  , nurse," answered Telemachus, "  scheme is   without
heaven   sanction; but swear         nothing      
    mother, till     been away some ten   twelve days, unless
she hears     having gone,   asks  ;         want    
spoil   beauty   crying." 

  old woman swore most solemnly   she    ,   when she
had completed   oath, she began drawing off   wine into jars,
  getting   barley meal into   bags, while Telemachus went back
    suitors. 

Then Minerva bethought     another matter. She took   shape,
  went round   town   each       crew, telling them   meet
    ship   sundown. She went also   Noemon son   Phronius,  
asked him   let       ship-     was very ready    . When
  sun had set   darkness was over     land, she got   ship
into   water, put     tackle   board     ships generally
carry,   stationed       end     harbour. Presently  
crew came  ,     goddess spoke encouragingly   each   them.

Furthermore she went     house   Ulysses,   threw   suitors
into   deep slumber. She caused   drink   fuddle them,   made
them drop   cups     hands,     instead   sitting
over   wine,   went back into   town   sleep,    
eyes heavy   full   drowsiness. Then she took   form   voice
  Mentor,   called Telemachus   come outside. 

"Telemachus," said she, "  men are   board       oars, waiting
      give your orders,   make haste   let us   off."

    she led   way, while Telemachus followed     steps. When
  got     ship   found   crew waiting     water side,
  Telemachus said, "Now   men, help         stores   board;
  are   put together     cloister,     mother does  
know anything    , nor any     maid servants except  ."

  these words   led   way     others followed after. When
  had brought   things     told them, Telemachus went   board,
Minerva going before him   taking   seat     stern     vessel,
while Telemachus sat beside  . Then   men loosed   hawsers  
took   places     benches. Minerva sent them   fair wind  
  West,   whistled over   deep blue waves whereon Telemachus
told them   catch hold     ropes   hoist sail,     did
    told them.   set   mast   its socket     cross plank,
raised  ,   made   fast     forestays; then   hoisted
  white sails aloft   ropes   twisted ox hide.     sail
bellied       wind,   ship flew through   deep blue water,
    foam hissed against   bows   she sped onward. Then  
made   fast throughout   ship, filled   mixing bowls    
brim,   made drink offerings     immortal gods   are  
everlasting, but more particularly     grey eyed daughter   Jove.

Thus, then,   ship sped     way through   watches     night
  dark till dawn.

BOOK III

But     sun was rising     fair sea into   firmament  
heaven   shed light   mortals   immortals,   reached Pylos
  city   Neleus. Now   people   Pylos were gathered     sea
shore   offer sacrifice   black bulls   Neptune lord     Earthquake.
  were nine guilds   five hundred men   each,     were
nine bulls   each guild.     were eating   inward meats  
burning   thigh bones [    embers]     name   Neptune, Telemachus
    crew arrived, furled   sails, brought   ship   anchor,
  went ashore. 

Minerva led   way   Telemachus followed  . Presently she said,
"Telemachus,   must         least shy   nervous;    
taken   voyage   try   find   where your father is buried
  how   came     end;     straight     Nestor     may
see     has got   tell us. Beg   him   speak   truth,  
    tell no lies,     is   excellent person." 

"But how, Mentor," replied Telemachus, "dare         Nestor,  
how am     address him?     never yet been used   holding long
conversations   people,   am ashamed   begin questioning  
  is   much older than myself." 

"Some things, Telemachus," answered Minerva, "    suggested  
    your own instinct,   heaven   prompt   further;  
  am assured     gods   been         time   your
birth until now." 

She then went quickly  ,   Telemachus followed     steps till
  reached   place where   guilds     Pylian people were
assembled.     found Nestor sitting     sons, while  
company round him were busy getting dinner ready,   putting pieces
  meat       spits while other pieces were cooking. When  
saw   strangers   crowded round them, took them     hand  
bade them take   places. Nestor   son Pisistratus   once offered
  hand   each   them,   seated them   some soft sheepskins
  were lying     sands near   father     brother Thrasymedes.
Then   gave them   portions     inward meats   poured wine
  them into   golden cup, handing     Minerva first,   saluting
      same time. 

"Offer   prayer, sir," said  , "  King Neptune,     is   feast
    are joining; when     duly prayed   made your drink offering,
pass   cup   your friend     may     also.   doubt    
  too lifts   hands   prayer,   man cannot live without God
    world. Still   is younger than   are,   is much    
age   myself,       handed     give     precedence."

    spoke   handed     cup. Minerva thought   very right  
proper   him     given     herself first; she accordingly began
praying heartily   Neptune. "  thou," she cried, "  encirclest
  earth, vouchsafe   grant   prayers   thy servants   call
upon thee. More especially   pray thee send down thy grace   Nestor
      sons; thereafter also make   rest     Pylian people
some handsome return     goodly hecatomb   are offering  .
Lastly, grant Telemachus   myself   happy issue,   respect    
matter   has brought us   our   Pylos." 

When she had thus made   end   praying, she handed   cup   Telemachus
    prayed likewise.      , when   outer meats were roasted
  had been taken off   spits,   carvers gave every man   portion
      made   excellent dinner.   soon     had had enough
  eat   drink, Nestor, knight   Gerene, began   speak.

"Now," said  , "  our guests   done   dinner,      
best   ask them     are.  , then, sir strangers, are  ,
      port     sailed? Are   traders?       sail
  seas   rovers   your hand against every man,   every man  
hand against  ?" 

Telemachus answered boldly,   Minerva had given him courage   ask
    father     himself   good name. 

"Nestor," said  , "son   Neleus, honour     Achaean name,  
ask whence   come,       tell  .   come   Ithaca under
Neritum,     matter         speak is   private  
public import.   seek news     unhappy father Ulysses,   is said
    sacked   town   Troy   company   yourself.   know
  fate befell each       other heroes   fought   Troy,
but   regards Ulysses heaven has hidden   us   knowledge even
    is dead    ,   no   can certify us     place  
perished, nor   whether   fell   battle     mainland,   was
lost   sea amid   waves   Amphitrite. Therefore   am suppliant
  your knees,   haply   may   pleased   tell       melancholy
end, whether   saw     your own eyes,   heard     some
other traveller,     was   man born   trouble.     soften things
    any pity    , but tell       plainness exactly  
  saw.     brave father Ulysses ever did   loyal service, either
  word   deed, when   Achaeans were harassed among   Trojans,
bear     mind now       favour   tell   truly  ."

"  friend," answered Nestor, "  recall   time   much sorrow  
  mind,     brave Achaeans suffered much both   sea, while privateering
under Achilles,   when fighting before   great city   king Priam.
Our best men     them fell  - Ajax, Achilles, Patroclus peer
  gods   counsel,     own dear son Antilochus,   man singularly
fleet   foot     fight valiant. But   suffered much more than
 ;   mortal tongue indeed could tell   whole story? Though
  were   stay here   question     five years,   even six,
  could   tell         Achaeans suffered,      
turn homeward weary     tale before   ended. Nine long years did
  try every kind   stratagem, but   hand   heaven was against

father   subtlety-   indeed   are   son-   can hardly believe

  such different ages could speak   much alike.       never had
any kind   difference   first   last neither   camp nor council,
but   singleness   heart   purpose   advised   Argives how
  might   ordered     best. 

"When however,   had sacked   city   Priam,   were setting sail
  our ships   heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit   vex
  Argives     homeward voyage;     had     been either
wise   understanding,   hence many came     bad end through  
displeasure   Jove   daughter Minerva,   brought     quarrel
between   two sons   Atreus. 

"  sons   Atreus called   meeting   was       should  ,
    was sunset     Achaeans were heavy   wine. When  
explained why   had called-   people together,   seemed  
Menelaus was   sailing homeward   once,     displeased Agamemnon,
  thought     should wait till   had offered hecatombs   appease
  anger   Minerva. Fool     was,   might   known    
    prevail    ,   when   gods   made     minds
      change them lightly.     two stood bandying hard words,
whereon   Achaeans sprang     feet     cry   rent  
air,   were   two minds         should  . 

"  night   rested   nursed our anger,   Jove was hatching
mischief against us. But     morning some   us drew our ships
into   water   put our goods   our women   board, while  
rest,   half   number, stayed behind   Agamemnon.  -  
other half- embarked   sailed;     ships went well,   heaven
had smoothed   sea. When   reached Tenedos   offered sacrifices
    gods,     were longing     home; cruel Jove, however,
did   yet mean     should    ,   raised   second quarrel
    course     some among us turned   ships back again,
  sailed away under Ulysses   make   peace   Agamemnon;
but  ,       ships   were     pressed forward,    
saw   mischief was brewing.   son   Tydeus went   also  
 ,     crews   him. Later   Menelaus joined us   Lesbos,
  found us making   our minds   our course-     did  
know whether     outside Chios     island   Psyra, keeping  
  our left,   inside Chios, over against   stormy headland  
Mimas.     asked heaven     sign,   were shown       effect
    should   soonest     danger     headed our ships across
  open sea   Euboea.     therefore did,     fair wind sprang
    gave us   quick passage during   night   Geraestus, where
  offered many sacrifices   Neptune   having helped us   far
  our way. Four days later Diomed     men stationed   ships
  Argos, but   held     Pylos,     wind never fell light  
  day when heaven first made   fair    . 

"Therefore,   dear young friend,   returned without hearing anything
    others.   know neither   got home safely nor   were
lost but,     duty bound,     give   without reserve   reports
    reached   since     been here     own house.  
    Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles' son Neoptolemus;
  also did   valiant son   Poias, Philoctetes. Idomeneus, again,
lost no men   sea,       followers   escaped death    
field got safe home   him   Crete. No matter how far      
world   live,       heard   Agamemnon     bad end  
came       hands   Aegisthus-     fearful reckoning did Aegisthus
presently pay. See     good thing   is     man   leave   son
behind him       Orestes did,   killed false Aegisthus   murderer
    noble father.   too, then-     are   tall, smart looking
fellow- show your mettle   make yourself   name   story."

"Nestor son   Neleus," answered Telemachus, "honour     Achaean
name,   Achaeans applaud Orestes     name   live through
  time     has avenged   father nobly.     heaven might
grant       like vengeance     insolence     wicked suitors,
  are ill treating     plotting   ruin; but   gods   no
such happiness   store           father,     must bear
    best   may." 

"  friend," said Nestor, "now     remind  ,   remember    
heard   your mother has many suitors,   are ill disposed towards
    are making havoc   your estate.     submit     tamely,
  are public feeling     voice   heaven against  ?   knows
but   Ulysses may come back after  ,   pay these scoundrels
  full, either single handed       force   Achaeans behind him?
  Minerva were   take   great   liking       she did   Ulysses
when   were fighting before Troy (    never yet saw   gods  
openly fond   any     Minerva then was   your father),   she
  take   good care       she did   him, these wooers  
soon some   them him, forget   wooing." 

Telemachus answered, "  can expect nothing     kind;      
far too much   hope  .   dare   let myself think    . Even
though   gods themselves willed   no such good fortune could befall
 ." 

    Minerva said, "Telemachus,   are   talking  ? Heaven
has   long arm     is minded   save   man;       were  ,  
should   care how much   suffered before getting home, provided
  could   safe when   was once  .     rather  , than  
home quickly,   then   killed     own house   Agamemnon was
    treachery   Aegisthus     wife. Still, death is certain,
  when   man   hour is come,   even   gods can save him, no
matter how fond   are   him." 

"Mentor," answered Telemachus, "    let us talk     any more.
  is no chance     father   ever coming back;   gods  
long since counselled   destruction.   is something else, however,
      should like   ask Nestor,     knows much more than
any   else does.       has reigned   three generations  
    is like talking     immortal. Tell  , therefore, Nestor,
  tell   true; how did Agamemnon come   die     way?  
was Menelaus doing?   how came false Aegisthus   kill   far better
  man than himself? Was Menelaus away   Achaean Argos, voyaging
elsewhither among mankind,   Aegisthus took heart   killed Agamemnon?"

"    tell   truly," answered Nestor, "  indeed     yourself
divined how     happened.   Menelaus when   got back   Troy
had found Aegisthus still alive     house,       been
no barrow heaped     him,   even when   was dead, but    
  been thrown outside   city   dogs   vultures,      
woman     mourned him,     had done   deed   great wickedness;
but   were over  , fighting hard   Troy,   Aegisthus   was
taking   ease quietly     heart   Argos, cajoled Agamemnon  
wife Clytemnestra   incessant flattery. 

"  first she     nothing         wicked scheme,  
she was     good natural disposition; moreover   was   bard  
 ,   whom Agamemnon had given strict orders   setting    
Troy,     was   keep guard over   wife; but when heaven had
counselled   destruction, Aegisthus thus   bard off     desert
island   left him     crows   seagulls   batten upon- after
  she went willingly enough     house   Aegisthus. Then  
offered many burnt sacrifices     gods,   decorated many temples
  tapestries   gilding,     had succeeded far beyond   expectations.

"Meanwhile Menelaus     were   our way home   Troy,   good
terms     another. When   got   Sunium,   is   point
  Athens, Apollo     painless shafts killed Phrontis   steersman
  Menelaus' ship (  never man knew better how   handle   vessel
  rough weather)       died then         helm  
  hand,   Menelaus, though very anxious   press forward, had
  wait   order   bury   comrade   give him   due funeral
rites. Presently, when   too could put   sea again,   had sailed
    far     Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him  
made     blow hard till   waves ran mountains high. Here   divided
  fleet   took     half towards Crete where   Cydonians
dwell round     waters     river Iardanus.   is   high
headland hereabouts stretching   into   sea     place called
Gortyn,     along   part     coast   far   Phaestus  
sea runs high when   is   south wind blowing, but arter Phaestus
  coast is more protected,     small headland can make   great
shelter. Here   part     fleet was driven       rocks  
wrecked; but   crews just managed   save themselves.      
other five ships,   were taken   winds   seas   Egypt, where
Menelaus gathered much gold   substance among people     alien
speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here   home plotted   evil deed.  
seven years after   had killed Agamemnon   ruled   Mycene,  
  people were obedient under him, but     eighth year Orestes
came back   Athens       bane,   killed   murderer    
father. Then   celebrated   funeral rites     mother    
false Aegisthus     banquet     people   Argos,       very
day Menelaus came home,     much treasure     ships could carry.

"Take   advice then,         travelling     long   far
  home, nor leave your property   such dangerous people   your
house;     eat   everything     among them,      
  been     fool   errand. Still,   should advise       means
      visit Menelaus,   has lately come off   voyage among such
distant peoples   no man could ever hope     back  , when  
winds had once carried him   far       reckoning; even birds
cannot fly   distance     twelvemonth,   vast   terrible are
  seas     must cross.     him, therefore,   sea,   take
your own men    ;         rather travel   land   can
    chariot,   can   horses,   here are   sons   can
escort     Lacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg   him   speak
  truth,       tell   no lies,     is   excellent person."

    spoke   sun set     came   dark, whereon Minerva said,
"Sir,         said is well; now, however, order   tongues
    victims     cut,   mix wine     may make drink offerings
  Neptune,     other immortals,   then     bed,     is
bed time. People should   away early     keep late hours    
religious festival." 

Thus spoke   daughter   Jove,     obeyed   saying. Men servants
poured water over   hands     guests, while pages filled  
mixing bowls   wine   water,   handed   round after giving
every man   drink offering; then   threw   tongues     victims
into   fire,   stood     make   drink offerings. When  
had made   offerings   had drunk each   much     was minded,
Minerva   Telemachus were forgoing   board   ship, but Nestor
caught them     once   stayed them. 

"Heaven     immortal gods,"   exclaimed, "forbid     should
leave   house       board     ship.     think   am   poor
  short   clothes,           few cloaks         unable
  find comfortable beds both   myself       guests? Let  
tell       store both   rugs   cloaks,   shall   permit
  son     old friend Ulysses   camp down     deck     ship-
  while   live- nor yet     sons after  , but     keep
open house     done." 

Then Minerva answered, "Sir,     spoken well,        
much better   Telemachus should         said;  , therefore,
shall return       sleep   your house, but   must   back
  give orders     crew,   keep them   good heart.   am   only
older person among them;   rest are   young men   Telemachus'
own age,     taken   voyage     friendship;     must return
    ship   sleep  . Moreover   morrow   must       Cauconians
where       large sum   money long owing    .     Telemachus,
now     is your guest, send him   Lacedaemon     chariot,  
let     your sons     him.   pleased also   provide him  
your best   fleetest horses." 

When she had thus spoken, she flew away     form     eagle,  
  marvelled     beheld  . Nestor was astonished,   took Telemachus
    hand. "  friend," said  , "  see     are going    
  great hero some day, since   gods wait upon   thus while  
are still   young.   can   been none other   those   dwell
  heaven than Jove   redoubtable daughter,   Trito born,   showed
such favour towards your brave father among   Argives." "Holy queen,"
  continued, "vouchsafe   send down thy grace upon myself,   good
wife,     children.   return,     offer     sacrifice  
broad browed heifer     year old, unbroken,   never yet brought
  man under   yoke.     gild   horns,     offer    
      sacrifice." 

Thus did   pray,   Minerva heard   prayer.   then led   way
    own house, followed     sons   sons   law. When  
had got     had taken   places     benches   seats,
  mixed them   bowl   sweet wine   was eleven years old when
  housekeeper took   lid off   jar   held  .     mixed
  wine,   prayed much   made drink offerings   Minerva, daughter
  Aegis bearing Jove. Then, when   had made   drink offerings
  had drunk each   much     was minded,   others went home
  bed each     own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus   sleep  
  room   was over   gateway along   Pisistratus,   was
  only unmarried son now left him.     himself,   slept    
inner room     house,     queen   wife     side.

Now when   child   morning, rosy fingered Dawn, appeared, Nestor
left   couch   took   seat     benches   white   polished
marble   stood   front     house. Here aforetime sat Neleus,
peer   gods   counsel, but   was now dead,   had gone    
house   Hades;   Nestor sat     seat, sceptre   hand,   guardian
    public weal.   sons     left   rooms gathered round
him, Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus,   Thrasymedes;   sixth
son was Pisistratus,   when Telemachus joined them   made him
sit   them. Nestor then addressed them. 

"  sons," said  , "make haste         shall bid  .   wish first
  foremost   propitiate   great goddess Minerva,   manifested
herself visibly     during yesterday   festivities.  , then,  
  other         plain, tell   stockman   look       heifer,
  come   here       once. Another must     Telemachus  
ship,   invite     crew, leaving two men only   charge    
vessel. Some   else   run   fetch Laerceus   goldsmith  
gild   horns     heifer.   rest, stay       where  
are; tell   maids     house   prepare   excellent dinner,  
  fetch seats,   logs   wood     burnt offering. Tell them also-
  bring   some clear spring water." 

      hurried off     several errands.   heifer was
brought       plain,   Telemachus   crew came     ship;
  goldsmith brought   anvil, hammer,   tongs,      
worked   gold,   Minerva herself came     sacrifice. Nestor
gave     gold,     smith gilded   horns     heifer  
  goddess might   pleasure     beauty. Then Stratius  
Echephron brought         horns; Aretus fetched water    
house     ewer   had   flower pattern    ,       other
hand   held   basket   barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood  
    sharp axe, ready   strike   heifer, while Perseus held  
bucket. Then Nestor began   washing   hands   sprinkling  
barley meal,     offered many   prayer   Minerva     threw  
lock     heifer   head upon   fire. 

When   had done praying   sprinkling   barley meal Thrasymedes
dealt   blow,   brought   heifer down     stroke   cut
through   tendons     base     neck, whereon   daughters
  daughters   law   Nestor,     venerable wife Eurydice (she
was eldest daughter   Clymenus) screamed   delight. Then  
lifted   heifer   head   off   ground,   Pisistratus cut
  throat. When she had done bleeding   was quite dead,   cut
   .   cut     thigh bones     due course, wrapped them
round   two layers   fat,   set some pieces   raw meat    
top   them; then Nestor laid them upon   wood fire   poured wine
over them, while   young men stood near him   five pronged spits
    hands. When   thighs were burned     had tasted  
inward meats,   cut   rest     meat   small, put   pieces
    spits   toasted them over   fire. 

Meanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor   youngest daughter, washed Telemachus.
When she had washed him   anointed him   oil, she brought him
  fair mantle   shirt,     looked like   god     came  
  bath   took   seat     side   Nestor. When   outer meats
were done   drew them off   spits   sat down   dinner where
  were waited upon   some worthy henchmen,   kept pouring them
    wine   cups   gold.   soon     had had had enough
  eat   drink Nestor said, "Sons, put Telemachus   horses    
chariot     may start   once." 

Thus did   speak,     did even     had said,   yoked  
fleet horses     chariot.   housekeeper packed them     provision
  bread, wine,   sweetmeats fit     sons   princes. Then Telemachus
got into   chariot, while Pisistratus gathered     reins  
took   seat beside him.   lashed   horses       flew forward
nothing loth into   open country, leaving   high citadel   Pylos
behind them.     day did   travel, swaying   yoke upon  
necks till   sun went down   darkness was over     land. Then
  reached Pherae where Diocles lived,   was son   Ortilochus
  grandson   Alpheus. Here   passed   night   Diocles entertained
them hospitably. When   child   morning, rosy fingered Dawn; appeared,
  again yoked   horses   drove   through   gateway under
  echoing gatehouse. Pisistratus lashed   horses       flew
forward nothing loth; presently   came     corn lands    
open country,       course   time completed   journey,  
well did   steeds take them. 

Now when   sun had set   darkness was over   land,

BOOK IV

  reached   low lying city   Lacedaemon them where   drove
straight       abode Menelaus [  found him     own house,
feasting     many clansmen   honour     wedding     son,
  also     daughter, whom   was marrying     son    
valiant warrior Achilles.   had given   consent   promised  
  him while   was still   Troy,   now   gods were bringing
  marriage  ;     was sending     chariots   horses
    city     Myrmidons over whom Achilles' son was reigning.
    only son   had found   bride   Sparta, daughter   Alector.
  son, Megapenthes, was born   him     bondwoman,   heaven
vouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione,  
was fair   golden Venus herself. 

    neighbours   kinsmen   Menelaus were feasting   making
merry     house.   was   bard also   sing   them   play
  lyre, while two tumblers went   performing     midst  
them when   man struck       tune.] 

Telemachus     son   Nestor stayed   horses     gate,
whereon Eteoneus servant   Menelaus came  ,     soon     saw
them ran hurrying back into   house   tell   Master.   went
close     him   said, "Menelaus,   are some strangers come
here, two men,   look like sons   Jove.   are      ? Shall
  take   horses  ,   tell them   find friends elsewhere  
  best can?" 

Menelaus was very angry   said, "Eteoneus, son   Boethous,  
never used       fool, but now   talk like   simpleton. Take  
horses  ,   course,   show   strangers       may  
supper;         stayed often enough   other people   houses
before   got back here, where heaven grant     may rest   peace
henceforward." 

  Eteoneus bustled back   bade other servants come   him.  
took   sweating hands   under   yoke, made them fast    
mangers,   gave them   feed   oats   barley mixed. Then  
leaned   chariot against   end wall     courtyard,   led
  way into   house. Telemachus   Pisistratus were astonished
when   saw  ,   its splendour was         sun   moon;
then, when   had admired everything     heart   content,  
went into   bath room   washed themselves. 

When   servants had washed them   anointed them   oil,  
brought them woollen cloaks   shirts,     two took   seats
    side   Menelaus.   maidservant brought them water     beautiful
golden ewer,   poured   into   silver basin   them   wash  
hands;   she drew   clean table beside them.   upper servant brought
them bread,   offered them many good things       was  
  house, while   carver fetched them plates     manner   meats
  set cups   gold     side. 

Menelaus then greeted them saying, "Fall  ,   welcome; when  
  done supper   shall ask     are,     lineage   such
men     cannot   been lost.   must   descended     line
  sceptre bearing kings,   poor people       such sons  
  are." 

      handed them   piece   fat roast loin,   had been set
near him   being   prime part,     laid   hands     good
things   were before them;   soon     had had enough   eat
  drink, Telemachus said     son   Nestor,     head  
close   no   might hear, "Look, Pisistratus, man after   own
heart, see   gleam   bronze   gold-   amber, ivory,   silver.
Everything is   splendid     is like seeing   palace   Olympian
Jove.   am lost   admiration." 

Menelaus overheard him   said, "No  ,   sons, can hold   own
  Jove,     house   everything   him is immortal; but
among mortal men- well,   may   another   has   much wealth

    ewes yield     year round. But while   was travelling
  getting great riches among these people,   brother was secretly
  shockingly murdered through   perfidy     wicked wife,

Thus spoke Menelaus,     heart   Telemachus yearned     bethought
him     father. Tears fell     eyes     heard him thus mentioned,
      held   cloak before   face   both hands. When Menelaus
saw     doubted whether   let him choose   own time   speaking,
    ask him   once   find     was    . 

While   was thus   two minds Helen came down     high vaulted
  perfumed room, looking   lovely   Diana herself. Adraste brought
    seat, Alcippe   soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched    
silver work box   Alcandra wife   Polybus had given  . Polybus
lived   Egyptian Thebes,   is   richest city     whole world;
  gave Menelaus two baths, both   pure silver, two tripods,  
ten talents   gold; besides    ,   wife gave Helen some beautiful
presents,   wit,   golden distaff,     silver work box   ran
  wheels,     gold band round   top    . Phylo now placed
      side, full   fine spun yarn,     distaff charged  
violet coloured wool was laid upon   top    . Then Helen took
  seat, put   feet upon   footstool,   began   question  
husband. 

"    know, Menelaus," said she, "  names   these strangers  
  come   visit us? Shall   guess right   wrong?-but   cannot
help saying     think. Never yet     seen either man   woman
  like somebody else (indeed when   look   him   hardly know  
  think)     young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left
    baby behind him, when   Achaeans went   Troy   battle  
your hearts,   account     most shameless self." 

"  dear wife," replied Menelaus, "  see   likeness just    
 .   hands   feet are just like Ulysses';   is   hair,  
  shape     head     expression     eyes. Moreover, when
  was talking   Ulysses,   saying how much   had suffered  
  account, tears fell     eyes,     hid   face     mantle."

Then Pisistratus said, "Menelaus, son   Atreus,   are right  
thinking     young man is Telemachus, but   is very modest,
  is ashamed   come here   begin opening   discourse    
whose conversation is   divinely interesting   your own.   father,
Nestor, sent     escort him hither,     wanted   know whether
  could give him any counsel   suggestion.   son has always trouble
  home when   father has gone away leaving him without supporters;
    is how Telemachus is now placed,     father is absent,
    is no   among   own people   stand   him."

"Bless   heart," replied Menelaus, "then   am receiving   visit  
  son     very dear friend,   suffered much hardship     sake.
  had always hoped   entertain him   most marked distinction when
heaven had granted us   safe return   beyond   seas.   should
  founded   city   him   Argos,   built him   house.   should
  made him leave Ithaca     goods,   son,       people,
  should   sacked   them some       neighbouring cities
  are subject    .   should thus   seen   another continually,
  nothing but death could   interrupted   close   happy  
intercourse.   suppose, however,   heaven grudged us such great
good fortune,     has prevented   poor fellow   ever getting
home    ." 

Thus did   speak,     words set them     weeping. Helen wept,
Telemachus wept,     did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep  
eyes   filling, when   remembered   dear brother Antilochus
whom   son   bright Dawn had killed. Thereon   said   Menelaus,

"Sir,   father Nestor, when   used   talk       home, told
    were   person   rare   excellent understanding.  , then,
    possible,         urge  .   am   fond   crying while
  am getting   supper. Morning   come   due course,      
forenoon   care   how much   cry   those   are dead   gone.
  is     can       poor things.   can only shave our heads
  them   wring   tears   our cheeks.   had   brother  
died   Troy;   was   no means   worst man  ;   are sure
    known him-   name was Antilochus;   never set eyes upon
him myself, but         was singularly fleet   foot  
  fight valiant." 

"Your discretion,   friend," answered Menelaus, "is beyond your years.
  is plain   take after your father.   can soon see when   man
is son     whom heaven has blessed both   regards wife   offspring-
    has blessed Nestor   first   last     days, giving
him   green old age     own house,   sons   him   are
both   disposed   valiant.     put   end therefore    
  weeping,   attend   our supper again. Let water   poured
over our hands. Telemachus     can talk     another fully  
  morning." 

    Asphalion,       servants, poured water over   hands
    laid   hands     good things   were before them.

Then Jove   daughter Helen bethought     another matter. She drugged
  wine     herb   banishes   care, sorrow,   ill humour.
Whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed   single tear    
rest     day,   even though   father   mother both   them
drop down dead,     sees   brother     son hewn   pieces before
  very eyes.   drug,   such sovereign power   virtue, had
been given   Helen   Polydamna wife   Thon,   woman   Egypt, where
  grow   sorts   herbs, some good   put into   mixing bowl
  others poisonous. Moreover, every       whole country is
  skilled physician,     are     race   Paeeon. When Helen
had put   drug     bowl,   had told   servants   serve
  wine round, she said: 

"Menelaus, son   Atreus,       good friends, sons   honourable
men (  is   Jove wills,     is   giver both   good  
evil,   can       chooses), feast here      ,   listen
while   tell     tale   season.   cannot indeed name every single
      exploits   Ulysses, but   can       did when  
was before Troy,     Achaeans were     sorts   difficulties.
  covered himself   wounds   bruises, dressed himself    
rags,   entered   enemy   city looking like   menial     beggar.
  quite different       did when   was among   own people.
    disguise   entered   city   Troy,   no   said anything
  him.   alone recognized him   began   question him, but   was
too cunning    . When, however,   had washed   anointed him  
had given him clothes,   after   had sworn   solemn oath    
betray him     Trojans till   had got safely back     own camp
      ships,   told         Achaeans meant    .  
killed many Trojans   got much information before   reached  
Argive camp,       things   Trojan women made lamentation,
but     own part   was glad,     heart was beginning   oam
after   home,     was unhappy   wrong   Venus had done  
  taking   over  , away     country,   girl,     lawful
wedded husband,   is indeed   no means deficient either   person
  understanding." 

Then Menelaus said, "        been saying,   dear wife,
is true.     travelled much,     had much       heroes,
but     never seen such another man   Ulysses.   endurance
too,     courage   displayed within   wooden horse, wherein
    bravest     Argives were lying   wait   bring death  
destruction upon   Trojans.     moment   came     us; some
god   wished well     Trojans must   set          
  had Deiphobus    . Three times did       round our hiding
place   pat  ;   called our chiefs each     own name,  
mimicked   our wives -Diomed, Ulysses,       our seats inside
heard     noise   made. Diomed     could   make   our minds
whether   spring   then    ,     answer     inside,
but Ulysses held us     check,     sat quite still,   except
Anticlus,   was beginning   answer  , when Ulysses clapped  
two brawny hands over   mouth,   kept them  .   was  
  saved us  ,     muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took   away
again." 

"How sad," exclaimed Telemachus, "      was   no avail  
save him, nor yet   own iron courage. But now, sir,   pleased  
send us     bed,     may lie down   enjoy   blessed boon
  sleep." 

    Helen told   maid servants   set beds     room  
was     gatehouse,     make them   good red rugs,   spread
coverlets     top   them   woollen cloaks     guests  
wear.     maids went  , carrying   torch,   made   beds,
      man servant presently conducted   strangers. Thus, then,
did Telemachus   Pisistratus sleep       forecourt, while
  son   Atreus lay     inner room   lovely Helen     side.

When   child   morning, rosy fingered Dawn, appeared, Menelaus
rose   dressed himself.   bound   sandals       comely feet,
girded   sword     shoulders,   left   room looking like
  immortal god. Then, taking   seat near Telemachus   said:

"   , Telemachus, has led     take   long sea voyage  
Lacedaemon? Are     public   private business? Tell      
 ." 

"    come, sir replied Telemachus, "  see     can tell   anything
    father.   am being eaten     house   home;   fair estate
is being wasted,     house is full   miscreants   keep killing
great numbers     sheep   oxen,     pretence   paying  
addresses     mother. Therefore,   am suppliant   your knees  
haply   may tell       father   melancholy end, whether

    brave father Ulysses ever did   loyal service either   word

mind now       favour   tell   truly  ." 

Menelaus   hearing   was very much shocked. " ,"   exclaimed,
"these cowards   usurp   brave man   bed?   hind might   well

"'Stranger,' replied she, '    make     quite clear    .

"'Stranger,' said she, '    make     quite clear    .

"When   child   morning, rosy fingered Dawn, appeared,   took

"'Son   Atreus,'   answered, 'why ask  ?   had better   know

kissed   native soil,   shed tears   joy   finding himself

"'Now   was   watchman whom Aegisthus kept always     watch,
    whom   had promised two talents   gold.   man had been
looking       whole year   make sure   Agamemnon did   give

  ambuscade     side   cloister, while     opposite side
  prepared   banquet. Then   sent   chariots   horsemen   Agamemnon,

"Thus spoke Proteus,     was broken hearted     heard him.   sat
down upon   sands   wept;   felt   though   could no longer bear
  live nor look upon   light     sun. Presently, when   had
had   fill   weeping   writhing upon   ground,   old man

  bitterly;   can   no manner   good; find your way home   fast

"      took comfort   spite       sorrow,   said, '  know,
then,   these two; tell  , therefore,     third man  
whom   spoke; is   still alive, but   sea,   unable     home?
  is   dead? Tell  , no matter how much   may grieve  .'

"'  third man,'   answered, 'is Ulysses   dwells   Ithaca.

"    spoke   dived under   waves, whereon   turned back    
ships     companions,     heart was clouded   care    
went along. When   reached   ships   got supper ready,   night
was falling,   camped down upon   beach. When   child   morning,
rosy fingered Dawn appeared,   drew our ships into   water,  
put our masts   sails within them; then   went   board ourselves,
took our seats     benches,   smote   grey sea   our oars.
  again stationed   ships     heaven fed stream   Egypt,  
offered hecatombs   were full   sufficient. When   had thus appeased
heaven   anger,   raised   barrow     memory   Agamemnon

    gods sent     fair wind. 

"  now   yourself- stay here some ten   twelve days longer,  
    then speed     your way.     make     noble present

    long     live   may think     whenever   make   drink offering
    immortal gods." 

"Son   Atreus," replied Telemachus, "    press     stay longer;
  should   contented   remain       another twelve months;
  find your conversation   delightful     should never once wish
myself   home     parents; but   crew whom     left   Pylos

wheat   barley,   oats     white   spreading ears; whereas
  Ithaca     neither open fields nor racecourses,     country
is more fit   goats than horses,     like     better    .
None   our islands   much level ground, suitable   horses,  
Ithaca least    ." 

Menelaus smiled   took Telemachus   hand within   own. "   
 ," said  , "shows     come   good family.   both can,  
 , make   exchange    ,   giving     finest   most
precious piece   plate       house.   is   mixing bowl   Vulcan  
own hand,   pure silver, except   rim,   is inlaid   gold.
Phaedimus, king     Sidonians, gave         course     visit
    paid him when   returned thither     homeward journey.  
  make     present    ." 

Thus did   converse [  guests kept coming     king   house.
  brought sheep   wine, while   wives had put   bread  
them   take   them;     were busy cooking   dinners  
  courts]. 

Meanwhile   suitors were throwing discs   aiming   spears  
  mark     levelled ground   front   Ulysses' house,   were
behaving       old insolence. Antinous   Eurymachus,  
were   ringleaders   much   foremost among them  , were
sitting together when Noemon son   Phronius came     said   Antinous,

"    any idea, Antinous,     day Telemachus returns   Pylos?
  has   ship   mine,     want  ,   cross over   Elis:    
twelve brood mares     yearling mule foals     side  
yet broken  ,     want   bring     them over here   break
him." 

  were astounded when   heard  ,     had made sure  
Telemachus had   gone     city   Neleus.   thought   was
only away somewhere     farms,   was     sheep,    
  swineherd;   Antinous said, "When did    ? Tell   truly,  
  young men did   take   him? Were   freemen     own
bondsmen-     might manage   too? Tell   also, did   let
him     ship   your own free   because   asked  ,   did
  take   without yourleave?" 

"  lent   him," answered Noemon, "  else could     when   man
    position said   was     difficulty,   asked     oblige
him?   could   possibly refuse.     those   went   him  
were   best young men    ,     saw Mentor     board   captain-
  some god   was exactly like him.   cannot understand  ,  
  saw Mentor here myself yesterday morning,   yet   was then setting
    Pylos." 

Noemon then went back     father   house, but Antinous   Eurymachus
were very angry.   told   others   leave off playing,    
come   sit down along   themselves. When   came, Antinous
son   Eupeithes spoke   anger.   heart was black   rage,  
  eyes flashed fire     said: 

"Good heavens,   voyage   Telemachus is   very serious matter;
  had made sure       come   nothing, but   young fellow
has got away   spite   us,       picked crew too.      
giving us trouble presently; may Jove take him before   is full grown.
Find     ship, therefore,     crew   twenty men,       lie
  wait   him     straits between Ithaca   Samos;     then
rue   day     set     try     news     father."

Thus did   speak,     others applauded   saying;   then
    them went inside   buildings. 

  was   long ere Penelope came   know     suitors were plotting;
    man servant, Medon, overheard them   outside   outer court
    were laying   schemes within,   went   tell   mistress.
    crossed   threshold     room Penelope said: "Medon,  
    suitors sent   here  ? Is     tell   maids   leave
  master   business   cook dinner   them?   wish   may
neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere else,
but let       very last time,     waste     make  
  son   estate. Did   your fathers tell   when   were children
how good Ulysses had been   them- never doing anything high handed,
nor speaking harshly   anybody? Kings may   things sometimes,  
  may take   fancy     man   dislike another, but Ulysses
never did   unjust thing   anybody-   shows   bad hearts
   ,       is no such thing   gratitude left    
world." 

Then Medon said, "  wish, Madam,     were  ; but   are
plotting something much more dreadful now- may heaven frustrate  
design.   are going   try   murder Telemachus     is coming
home   Pylos   Lacedaemon, where   has been     news    
father." 

Then Penelope   heart sank within  ,       long time she was
speechless;   eyes filled   tears,   she could find no utterance.
  last, however, she said, "Why did   son leave  ?   business
had       sailing off   ships   make long voyages over  
ocean like sea horses? Does   want   die without leaving any  
behind him   keep     name?" 

"      know," answered Medon, "whether some god set him      ,
  whether   went     own impulse   see     could find  
    father was dead,   alive       way home." 

Then   went downstairs again, leaving Penelope     agony   grief.
  were plenty   seats     house, but she. had no heart  
sitting   any     them; she could only fling herself     floor
    own room   cry; whereon     maids     house, both
old   young, gathered round     began   cry too, till   last
    transport   sorrow she exclaimed, 

"  dears, heaven has been pleased   try     more affliction
than any other woman     age   country. First   lost   brave
  lion hearted husband,   had every good quality under heaven,
  whose name was great over   Hellas   middle Argos,   now
  darling son is     mercy     winds   waves, without  
having heard   word     leaving home.   hussies,   was
            much   think   giving     call      
bed, though         very well knew when   was starting.  
  had known   meant taking   voyage,       had   give
   , no matter how much   was bent upon  ,   leave     corpse
behind him-     other. Now, however,   some       call old
Dolius,   was given       father     marriage,     is  
gardener. Bid him     once   tell everything   Laertes,   may
  able   hit   some plan   enlisting public sympathy   our side,
  against those   are trying   exterminate   own race    
  Ulysses." 

Then   dear old nurse Euryclea said, "  may kill  , Madam,  
let   live     your house, whichever   please, but     tell
    real truth.   knew      ,   gave him everything  
wanted     way   bread   wine, but   made   take   solemn
oath         tell   anything   some ten   twelve days,
unless   asked   happened   hear     having gone,     did
  want     spoil your beauty   crying.   now, Madam, wash
your face, change your dress,     upstairs   your maids   offer
prayers   Minerva, daughter   Aegis bearing Jove,   she can save
him even though         jaws   death.     trouble Laertes:
  has trouble enough already. Besides,   cannot think     gods
hate die race     race     son   Arceisius   much, but  
      son left   come   after him,   inherit both   house
    fair fields   lie far   round  ." 

  these words she made   mistress leave off crying,   dried
  tears     eyes. Penelope washed   face, changed   dress,
  went upstairs     maids. She then put some bruised barley
into   basket   began praying   Minerva. 

"Hear  ," she cried, "Daughter   Aegis bearing Jove, unweariable.
  ever Ulysses while   was here burned   fat thigh bones   sheep
  heifer, bear     mind now       favour,   save   darling
son     villainy     suitors." 

She cried aloud   she spoke,     goddess heard   prayer; meanwhile
  suitors were clamorous throughout   covered cloister,    
  them said: 

"  queen is preparing     marriage       other   us.
Little does she dream     son has now been doomed   die."

  was     said, but   did   know   was going   happen.
Then Antinous said, "Comrades, let     no loud talking, lest
some       carried inside. Let us             silence,
      are       mind." 

  then chose twenty men,     went down    . ship    
  sea side;   drew   vessel into   water   got   mast
  sails inside  ;   bound   oars     thole pins   twisted
thongs   leather,     due course,   spread   white sails aloft,
while   fine servants brought them   armour. Then   made
  ship fast   little way  , came   shore again, got   suppers,
  waited till night should fall. 

But Penelope lay     own room upstairs unable   eat   drink,
  wondering whether   brave son   escape,     overpowered
    wicked suitors. Like   lioness caught     toils   huntsmen
hemming       every side she thought   thought till she sank
into   slumber,   lay     bed bereft   thought   motion.

Then Minerva bethought     another matter,   made   vision  
  likeness   Penelope   sister Iphthime daughter   Icarius  
had married Eumelus   lived   Pherae. She told   vision    
    house   Ulysses,     make Penelope leave off crying,  
  came into   room     hole through     thong went  
pulling   door  ,   hovered over   head, saying, 

"  are asleep, Penelope:   gods   live   ease     suffer
    weep       sad. Your son has done them no wrong,    
  yet come back    ." 

Penelope,   was sleeping sweetly     gates   dreamland, answered,
"Sister, why     come here?       come very often, but  
suppose   is because   live such   long way off. Am  , then,
  leave off crying   refrain       sad thoughts   torture
 ?  ,     lost   brave   lion hearted husband,   had every
good quality under heaven,   whose name was great over   Hellas
  middle Argos;   now   darling son has gone off   board  
  ship-   foolish fellow   has never been used   roughing  , nor
  going   among gatherings   men.   am even more anxious  
him than     husband;   am       tremble when   think   him,
lest something should happen   him, either     people among
whom   has gone,     sea,     has many enemies   are plotting
against him,   are bent   killing him before   can return home."

Then   vision said, "Take heart,         much dismayed.  
is   gone   him whom many   man     glad enough    
stand     side,   mean Minerva;   is she   has compassion upon
 ,     has sent     bear     message." 

"Then," said Penelope, "    are   god     been sent here  
divine commission, tell   also     other unhappy  - is  
still alive,   is   already dead       house   Hades?"

    vision said, "  shall   tell     certain whether  
is alive   dead,     is no use   idle conversation."

Then   vanished through   thong hole     door   was dissipated
into thin air; but Penelope rose     sleep refreshed   comforted,
  vivid had been   dream. 

Meantime   suitors went   board   sailed   ways over  
sea, intent   murdering Telemachus. Now   is   rocky islet called
Asteris,   no great size,   mid channel between Ithaca   Samos,
    is   harbour   either side     where   ship can lie.
Here then   Achaeans placed themselves   ambush.

BOOK  

  now,   Dawn rose     couch beside Tithonus- harbinger  
light alike   mortals   immortals-   gods met   council  
  them, Jove   lord   thunder,   is   king. Thereon Minerva
began   tell them     many sufferings   Ulysses,   she pitied
him away       house     nymph Calypso. 

"Father Jove," said she, "      other gods   live   everlasting
bliss,   hope   may never   such   thing     kind   well disposed
ruler any more, nor       govern equitably.   hope    
    henceforth cruel   unjust,     is         subjects
but has forgotten Ulysses,   ruled them   though   were  
father.     is, lying   great pain     island where dwells
  nymph Calypso,       let him  ;     cannot   back
    own country,     can find neither ships nor sailors   take
him over   sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying   murder
  only son Telemachus,   is coming home   Pylos   Lacedaemon,
where   has been   see     can   news     father."

" ,   dear, are   talking  ?" replied   father, "did  
  send him   yourself, because   thought     help Ulysses
    home   punish   suitors? Besides,   are perfectly able
  protect Telemachus,     see him safely home again, while  
suitors     come hurry skurrying back without having killed him."

When   had thus spoken,   said     son Mercury, "Mercury,  
are our messenger,   therefore   tell Calypso     decreed  
poor Ulysses is   return home.   is     convoyed neither   gods
nor men, but after   perilous voyage   twenty days upon   raft  
is   reach fertile Scheria,   land     Phaeacians,   are near
  kin     gods,     honour him   though   were     ourselves.
    send him     ship     own country,     give him
more bronze   gold   raiment than       brought back  
Troy,     had had had     prize money   had got home without
disaster.   is how     settled     shall return    
country     friends." 

Thus   spoke,   Mercury, guide   guardian, slayer   Argus, did
    was told. Forthwith   bound     glittering golden sandals
      could fly like   wind over land   sea.   took  
wand       seals men   eyes   sleep   wakes them just  
  pleases,   flew holding       hand over Pieria; then   swooped
down through   firmament till   reached   level     sea, whose
waves   skimmed like   cormorant   flies fishing every hole  
corner     ocean,   drenching its thick plumage     spray.
  flew   flew over many   weary wave, but when   last   got  
  island   was   journey   end,   left   sea   went  
  land till   came     cave where   nymph Calypso lived.

  found     home.   was   large fire burning     hearth,
    could smell   far   fragrant reek   burning cedar  
sandal wood.     herself, she was busy     loom, shooting  
golden shuttle through   warp   singing beautifully. Round  
cave   was   thick wood   alder, poplar,   sweet smelling cypress
trees, wherein   kinds   great birds had built   nests- owls,
hawks,   chattering sea crows   occupy   business    
waters.   vine loaded   grapes was trained   grew luxuriantly
    mouth     cave;   were also four running rills  
water   channels cut pretty close together,   turned hither  
thither       irrigate   beds   violets   luscious herbage
over     flowed. Even   god could   help being charmed  
such   lovely spot,   Mercury stood still   looked    ; but when
  had admired   sufficiently   went inside   cave. 

Calypso knew him   once-     gods   know each other, no matter
how far   live     another- but Ulysses was   within;  
was     sea shore   usual, looking   upon   barren ocean  
tears     eyes, groaning   breaking   heart   sorrow. Calypso
gave Mercury   seat   said: "Why     come   see  , Mercury-
honoured,   ever welcome-         visit   often?    
  want;                 once     can,       can
  done    ; but come inside,   let   set refreshment before
 . 

  she spoke she drew   table loaded   ambrosia beside him  
mixed him some red nectar,   Mercury ate   drank till   had had
enough,   then said: 

"  are speaking god   goddess     another,   another,  
  ask   why     come here,       tell   truly    
       . Jove sent  ;   was no doing   mine;   could
possibly want   come     way over   sea where   are no
cities full   people   offer   sacrifices   choice hecatombs?
Nevertheless   had   come,   none   us other gods can cross Jove,
nor transgress   orders.   says       here   most ill starred
  alf those   fought nine years before   city   King Priam  
sailed home     tenth year after having sacked  .     way
home   sinned against Minerva,   raised both wind   waves against
them,         brave companions perished,     alone was
carried hither   wind   tide. Jove says     are   let  
  man     once,     is decreed     shall   perish here,
far     own people, but shall return     house   country
  see   friends again." 

Calypso trembled   rage when she heard  , "  gods," she exclaimed,
    ashamed   yourselves.   are always jealous   hate seeing
  goddess take   fancy     mortal man,   live   him   open
matrimony.   when rosy fingered Dawn made love   Orion,   precious
gods were       furious till Diana went   killed him   Ortygia.
  again when Ceres fell   love   Iasion,   yielded   him  
  thrice ploughed fallow field, Jove came   hear     before  
long   killed Iasion     thunder bolts.   now   are angry
    too because       man here.   found   poor creature sitting
  alone astride     keel,   Jove had struck   ship   lightning
  sunk     mid ocean,         crew were drowned, while
  himself was driven   wind   waves       island.   got fond
  him   cherished him,   had set   heart   making him immortal,
      should never grow old     days; still   cannot cross
Jove, nor bring   counsels   nothing; therefore,     insists
upon  , let   man   beyond   seas again; but   cannot send him
anywhere myself       neither ships nor men   can take him.
Nevertheless     readily give him such advice,     good faith,
      likely   bring him safely     own country."

"Then send him away," said Mercury, "  Jove     angry    
  punish  "' 

      took   leave,   Calypso went     look   Ulysses,
  she had heard Jove   message. She found him sitting upon   beach
    eyes ever filled   tears,   dying   sheer home sickness;
    had got tired   Calypso,   though   was forced   sleep
        cave   night,   was she,    ,      
   .       day time,   spent       rocks       sea shore,
weeping, crying aloud     despair,   always looking   upon
  sea. Calypso then went close     him said: 

"  poor fellow,   shall   stay here grieving   fretting your
life   any longer.   am going   send   away     own free  ;
   , cut some beams   wood,   make yourself   large raft  
  upper deck     may carry   safely over   sea.     put
bread, wine,   water   board   save     starving.    
also give   clothes,     send     fair wind   take   home,
    gods   heaven      -     know more   these things,
  can settle them better than   can." 

Ulysses shuddered     heard  . "Now goddess,"   answered, " 
is something behind    ;   cannot   really meaning   help
  home when   bid     such   dreadful thing   put   sea  
  raft.   even   well found ship     fair wind could venture
  such   distant voyage: nothing     can       shall mage
      board   raft unless   first solemnly swear     mean
  no mischief." 

Calypso smiled       caressed him     hand: "  know  
great deal," said she, "but   are quite wrong here. May heaven above
  earth below     witnesses,     waters     river Styx-
    is   most solemn oath     blessed god can take-  
  mean   no sort   harm,   am only advising       exactly
    should   myself   your place.   am dealing     quite
straightforwardly;   heart is   made   iron,     am very sorry
   ." 

When she had thus spoken she led   way rapidly before him,   Ulysses
followed     steps;     pair, goddess   man, went      
till   came   Calypso   cave, where Ulysses took   seat  
Mercury had just left. Calypso set meat   drink before him    
food   mortals eat; but   maids brought ambrosia   nectar  
herself,     laid   hands     good things   were before
them. When   had satisfied themselves   meat   drink, Calypso
spoke, saying: 

"Ulysses, noble son   Laertes,       start home   your own
land   once? Good luck      , but     could only know how
much suffering is   store     before     back   your own
country,     stay where   are, keep house along    ,  
let   make   immortal, no matter how anxious   may     see
  wife   yours,   whom   are thinking     time day after
day; yet   flatter myself     am no whit less tall   well looking
than she is,     is       expected     mortal woman should
compare   beauty     immortal." 

"Goddess," replied Ulysses, "      angry        .  
am quite aware     wife Penelope is nothing like   tall    
beautiful   yourself. She is only   woman, whereas   are   immortal.
Nevertheless,   want     home,   can think   nothing else.  
some god wrecks   when   am     sea,     bear     make  
best    .     had infinite trouble both   land   sea already,
  let         rest." 

Presently   sun set     became dark, whereon   pair retired
into   inner part     cave   went   bed. 

When   child   morning, rosy fingered Dawn, appeared, Ulysses put
    shirt   cloak, while   goddess wore   dress     light
gossamer fabric, very fine   graceful,     beautiful golden girdle
    waist     veil   cover   head. She   once set herself
  think how she could speed Ulysses     way.   she gave him  
great bronze axe   suited   hands;   was sharpened   both sides,
  had   beautiful olive wood handle fitted firmly      . She
also gave him   sharp adze,   then led   way     far end  
  island where   largest trees grew- alder, poplar   pine,  
reached   sky- very dry   well seasoned,       sail light  
him     water. Then, when she had shown him where   best trees
grew, Calypso went home, leaving him   cut them,     soon finished
doing.   cut down twenty trees       adzed them smooth, squaring
them   rule   good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso came back
  some augers,     bored holes   them   fitted   timbers
together   bolts   rivets.   made   raft   broad     skilled
shipwright makes   beam     large vessel,     filed   deck  
top     ribs,   ran   gunwale   round  .   also made   mast
    yard arm,     rudder   steer  .   fenced   raft  
round   wicker hurdles     protection against   waves,   then
  threw     quantity   wood.       Calypso brought him some
linen   make   sails,     made these too, excellently, making
them fast   braces   sheets. Last    ,     help   levers,
  drew   raft down into   water. 

  four days   had completed   whole work,       fifth Calypso
sent him     island after washing him   giving him some clean
clothes. She gave him   goat skin full   black wine,   another
larger     water; she also gave him   wallet full   provisions,
  found him   much good meat. Moreover, she made   wind fair
  warm   him,   gladly did Ulysses spread   sail before  ,
while   sat   guided   raft skilfully   means     rudder.
  never closed   eyes, but kept them fixed     Pleiads,   late setting
Bootes,       Bear-   men also call   wain,     turns
round   round where   is, facing Orion,   alone never dipping
into   stream   Oceanus-   Calypso had told him   keep  
    left. Days seven   ten did   sail over   sea,      
eighteenth   dim outlines     mountains     nearest part  
  Phaeacian coast appeared, rising like   shield     horizon.

But King Neptune,   was returning     Ethiopians, caught sight
  Ulysses   long way off,     mountains     Solymi.   could
see him sailing upon   sea,     made him very angry,     wagged
  head   muttered   himself, saying, heavens,     gods  
been changing   minds   Ulysses while   was away   Ethiopia,
  now   is close     land     Phaeacians, where   is decreed
    shall escape     calamities     befallen him. Still,
  shall   plenty   hardship yet before   has done    ."

Thereon   gathered   clouds together, grasped   trident, stirred
  round     sea,   roused   rage   every wind   blows
till earth, sea,   sky were hidden   cloud,   night sprang forth
      heavens. Winds   East, South, North,   West fell upon
him       same time,     tremendous sea got  ,     Ulysses'
heart began   fail him. "Alas,"   said   himself     dismay,
"  ever   become    ?   am afraid Calypso was right when she
said   should   trouble   sea before   got back home.   is  
coming true. How black is Jove making heaven     clouds,  
    sea   winds are raising   every quarter   once.   am
now safe   perish. Blest   thrice blest were those Danaans  
fell before Troy     cause     sons   Atreus.     had
been killed     day when   Trojans were pressing     sorely
    dead body   Achilles,   then   should   had due burial
    Achaeans     honoured   name; but now   seems  
  shall come     most pitiable end." 

    spoke   sea broke over him   such terrific fury    
raft reeled again,     was carried overboard   long way off.  
let     helm,     force     hurricane was   great  
  broke   mast half way  ,   both sail   yard went over into
  sea.     long time Ulysses was under water,     was    
could     rise     surface again,     clothes Calypso had
given him weighed him down; but   last   got   head above water
  spat     bitter brine   was running down   face   streams.
  spite      , however,   did   lose sight     raft,
but swam   fast     could towards  , got hold    ,   climbed
  board again       escape drowning.   sea took   raft  
tossed       Autumn winds whirl thistledown round   round
upon   road.   was   though   South, North, East,   West winds
were   playing battledore   shuttlecock       once.

When   was     plight, Ino daughter   Cadmus, also called Leucothea,
saw him. She had formerly been   mere mortal, but had been since raised
    rank     marine goddess. Seeing     great distress Ulysses
now was, she had compassion upon him,  , rising like   sea gull
    waves, took   seat upon   raft. 

"  poor good man," said she, "why is Neptune   furiously angry  
 ?   is giving     great deal   trouble, but       bluster
      kill  .   seem       sensible person,   then  
  bid  ; strip, leave your raft   drive before   wind,   swim
    Phaecian coast where better luck awaits  .   here, take
  veil   put   round your chest;   is enchanted,     can
come   no harm   long     wear  .   soon     touch land
take   off, throw   back   far     can into   sea,   then
  away again."   these words she took off   veil   gave  
him. Then she dived down again like   sea gull   vanished beneath
  dark blue waters. 

But Ulysses did   know     think. "Alas,"   said   himself
    dismay, "  is only some     other     gods   is
luring     ruin   advising       quit   raft.   any rate
            present,     land where she said   should
  quit     troubles seemed     still   good way off.   know
       -   am sure       best- no matter   happens
    stick     raft   long     timbers hold together, but
when   sea breaks         swim    ;       see how  
can   any better than  ." 

While   was thus   two minds, Neptune sent   terrible great wave
  seemed   rear itself above   head till   broke right over
  raft,   then went   pieces   though   were   heap   dry
chaff tossed       whirlwind. Ulysses got astride     plank
  rode upon         were   horseback;   then took off  
clothes Calypso had given him, bound Ino   veil under   arms,  
plunged into   sea- meaning   swim   shore. King Neptune watched
him     did  ,   wagged   head, muttering   himself   saying,
"'  now, swim     down     best can till   fall    
well     people.       think       able          
let   off too lightly."       lashed   horses   drove  
Aegae where   palace is. 

But Minerva resolved   help Ulysses,   she bound   ways    
  winds except  ,   made them lie quite still; but she roused
  good stiff breeze     North   should lay   waters till
Ulysses reached   land     Phaeacians where       safe.

Thereon   floated     two nights   two days     water,
    heavy swell     sea   death staring him     face; but
when   third day broke,   wind fell     was   dead calm
without   much     breath   air stirring.     rose     swell
  looked eagerly ahead,   could see land quite near. Then,   children
rejoice when   dear father begins     better after having  
  long time borne sore affliction sent him   some angry spirit, but
  gods deliver him   evil,   was Ulysses thankful when   again
saw land   trees,   swam         strength     might
once more set foot upon dry ground. When, however,   got within earshot,
  began   hear   surf thundering   against   rocks,    
swell still broke against them     terrific roar. Everything was
enveloped   spray;   were no harbours where   ship might ride,
nor shelter   any kind, but only headlands, low lying rocks,  
mountain tops. 

Ulysses' heart now began   fail him,     said despairingly  
himself, "Alas, Jove has let   see land after swimming   far  
  had given     hope, but   can find no landing place,    
coast is rocky   surf beaten,   rocks are smooth   rise sheer
    sea,   deep water close under them       cannot climb
    want   foothold.   am afraid some great wave   lift  
off   legs   dash   against   rocks     leave   water-  
  give     sorry landing.  ,     other hand,   swim further
  search   some shelving beach   harbour,   hurricane may carry
      sea again sorely against    ,   heaven may send some
great monster     deep   attack  ;   Amphitrite breeds many
such,     know   Neptune is very angry    ." 

While   was thus   two minds   wave caught him   took him  
such force against   rocks         been smashed   torn
  pieces   Minerva had   shown him      .   caught hold
    rock   both hands   clung     groaning   pain till
  wave retired,     was saved   time; but presently   wave
came   again   carried him back     far into   sea tearing
  hands     suckers     polypus are torn when some   plucks
    its bed,     stones come   along     even   did
  rocks tear   skin     strong hands,   then   wave drew
him deep down under   water. 

Here poor Ulysses     certainly perished even   spite    
own destiny,   Minerva had   helped him   keep   wits  
him.   swam seaward again, beyond reach     surf   was beating
against   land,       same time   kept looking towards  
shore   see     could find some haven,     spit   should take
  waves aslant.      ,     swam  ,   came     mouth  
  river,   here   thought       best place,     were
no rocks,     afforded shelter     wind.   felt    
was   current,     prayed inwardly   said: 

"Hear  ,   King, whoever   may  ,   save       anger  
  sea god Neptune,     approach   prayerfully. Any     has
lost   way has     times   claim even upon   gods, wherefore
    distress   draw near   your stream,   cling     knees
  your riverhood.   mercy upon  ,   king,     declare myself
your suppliant." 

Then   god stayed   stream   stilled   waves, making   calm
before him,   bringing him safely into   mouth     river. Here
  last Ulysses' knees   strong hands failed him,     sea had
completely broken him.   body was   swollen,     mouth  
nostrils ran down like   river   sea water,       could neither
breathe nor speak,   lay swooning   sheer exhaustion; presently,
when   had got   breath   came   himself again,   took off
  scarf   Ino had given him   threw   back into   salt stream
    river, whereon Ino received   into   hands     wave
  bore   towards  . Then   left   river, laid himself down
among   rushes,   kissed   bounteous earth. 

"Alas,"   cried   himself     dismay, "  ever   become
   ,   how is       end?     stay here upon   river bed
through   long watches     night,   am   exhausted    
bitter cold   damp may make   end    -   towards sunrise  
      keen wind blowing   off   river.  ,     other hand,
  climb   hill side, find shelter     woods,   sleep   some
thicket,   may escape   cold       good night   rest, but some
savage beast may take advantage       devour  ." 

    end   deemed   best   take     woods,     found  
upon some high ground   far     water.     crept beneath
two shoots   olive   grew     single stock-       ungrafted
sucker, while   other had been grafted. No wind, however squally,
could break through   cover   afforded, nor could   sun   rays
pierce them, nor   rain   through them,   closely did   grow
into   another. Ulysses crept under these   began   make himself
  bed   lie  ,     was   great litter   dead leaves lying
 - enough   make   covering   two   three men even   hard
winter weather.   was glad enough   see  ,     laid himself
down   heaped   leaves   round him. Then,       lives alone
    country, far   any neighbor, hides   brand   fire seed
    ashes   save himself   having       light elsewhere,
even   did Ulysses cover himself     leaves;   Minerva shed
  sweet sleep upon   eyes, closed   eyelids,   made him lose
  memories     sorrows.

BOOK VI

  here Ulysses slept, overcome   sleep   toil; but Minerva went
off     country   city     Phaecians-   people   used  
live     fair town   Hypereia, near   lawless Cyclopes. Now
  Cyclopes were stronger than     plundered them,    
king Nausithous moved them thence   settled them   Scheria, far
    other people.   surrounded   city     wall, built houses
  temples,   divided   lands among   people; but   was dead
  gone     house   Hades,   King Alcinous, whose counsels
were inspired   heaven, was now reigning.     house, then, did
Minerva hie   furtherance     return   Ulysses. 

She went straight     beautifully decorated bedroom      
slept   girl   was   lovely     goddess, Nausicaa, daughter  
King Alcinous. Two maid servants were sleeping near  , both very
pretty,     either side     doorway,   was closed   well made
folding doors. Minerva took   form     famous sea captain Dymas  
daughter,   was   bosom friend   Nausicaa   just   own age;
then, coming       girl   bedside like   breath   wind, she hovered
over   head   said: 

"Nausicaa,   can your mother   been  ,     such   lazy
daughter? Here are your clothes   lying   disorder, yet   are
going     married almost immediately,   should   only   well
dressed yourself, but should find good clothes   those   attend
 .   is   way     yourself   good name,     make your
father   mother proud    . Suppose, then,     make tomorrow
  washing day,   start   daybreak.     come   help    
    may   everything ready   soon   possible,      
best young men among your own people are courting  ,     are
  going   remain   maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore,
      waggon   mules ready   us   daybreak,   take   rugs,
robes,   girdles;     can ride, too,       much pleasanter
    than walking,     washing cisterns are some way    
town." 

When she had said   Minerva went away   Olympus,      
is   everlasting home     gods. Here no wind beats roughly,  
neither rain nor snow can fall; but   abides   everlasting sunshine
      great peacefulness   light, wherein   blessed gods are
illumined   ever   ever.   was   place       goddess
went when she had given instructions     girl. 

      morning came   woke Nausicaa,   began wondering  
  dream; she therefore went     other end     house   tell
  father   mother      ,   found them     own room.
  mother was sitting     fireside spinning   purple yarn  
  maids around  ,   she happened   catch   father just  
  was going     attend   meeting     town council,    
Phaeacian aldermen had convened. She stopped him   said:

"Papa dear, could   manage   let       good big waggon?   want
  take   our dirty clothes     river   wash them.   are
  chief man here,     is only right     should     clean
shirt when   attend meetings     council. Moreover,    
five sons   home, two   them married, while   other three are
good looking bachelors;   know   always like     clean linen
when         dance,       been thinking      ."

She did       word     own wedding,   she did   like
 , but   father knew   said, "  shall     mules,   love,
  whatever else       mind  .   off    ,     men
shall       good strong waggon     body         hold
  your clothes." 

      gave   orders     servants,   got   waggon  ,
harnessed   mules,   put them  , while   girl brought   clothes
down     linen room   placed them     waggon.   mother
prepared     basket   provisions     sorts   good things,
    goat skin full   wine;   girl now got into   waggon,  
  mother gave   also   golden cruse   oil,   she     women
might anoint themselves. Then she took   whip   reins   lashed
  mules  , whereon   set off,     hoofs clattered    
road.   pulled without flagging,   carried   only Nausicaa
    wash   clothes, but   maids also   were    .

When   reached   water side   went     washing cisterns,
through     ran     times enough pure water   wash any
quantity   linen, no matter how dirty. Here   unharnessed  
mules   turned them     feed     sweet juicy herbage  
grew     water side.   took   clothes       waggon, put
them     water,   vied     another   treading them    
pits       dirt  . After   had washed them   got them
quite clean,   laid them       sea side, where   waves had
raised   high beach   shingle,   set   washing themselves  
anointing themselves   olive oil. Then   got   dinner  
  side     stream,   waited     sun   finish drying  
clothes. When   had done dinner   threw off   veils   covered
  heads   began   play   ball, while Nausicaa sang   them.
    huntress Diana goes forth upon   mountains   Taygetus  
Erymanthus   hunt wild boars   deer,     wood nymphs, daughters
  Aegis bearing Jove, take   sport along     (then is Leto
proud   seeing   daughter stand   full head taller than   others,
  eclipse   loveliest amid   whole bevy   beauties), even  
did   girl outshine   handmaids. 

When   was time   them   start home,     were folding  
clothes   putting them into   waggon, Minerva began   consider
how Ulysses should wake     see   handsome girl   was   conduct
him     city     Phaeacians.   girl, therefore, threw   ball
        maids,   missed     fell into deep water.  
      shouted,     noise   made woke Ulysses,   sat
      bed   leaves   began   wonder     might    .

"Alas," said     himself, "  kind   people     come amongst?
Are   cruel, savage,   uncivilized,   hospitable   humane?
  seem   hear   voices   young women,     sound like those
    nymphs   haunt mountain tops,   springs   rivers   meadows
  green grass.   any rate   am among   race   men   women. Let
  try     cannot manage       look   them." 

    said     crept   under   bush,   broke off   bough
covered   thick leaves   hide   nakedness.   looked like some
lion     wilderness   stalks   exulting     strength
  defying both wind   rain;   eyes glare     prowls   quest
  oxen, sheep,   deer,     is famished,     dare break even
into   well fenced homestead, trying         sheep- even such
did Ulysses seem     young women,     drew near   them   naked
    was,     was   great want.   seeing     unkempt  
  begrimed   salt water,   others scampered off along   spits
  jutted   into   sea, but   daughter   Alcinous stood firm,
  Minerva put courage into   heart   took away   fear  
 . She stood right   front   Ulysses,     doubted whether  
should        , throw himself     feet,   embrace   knees
    suppliant,   stay where   was   entreat     give him some
clothes   show him   way     town.     end   deemed  
best   entreat       distance   case   girl should take offence
    coming near enough   clasp   knees,     addressed  
  honeyed   persuasive language. 

"  queen,"   said, "  implore your aid- but tell  , are     goddess
  are     mortal woman?     are   goddess   dwell   heaven,
  can only conjecture     are Jove   daughter Diana,   your

thrice happy, too, are your brothers   sisters; how proud   delighted
  must feel when   see   fair   scion   yourself going

  now fate has flung   upon   coast     may endure still
further suffering;         think       yet come    
end    , but rather   heaven has still much evil   store  
 . 

"  now,   queen,   pity upon  ,     are   first person
    met,     know no   else     country. Show     way

friends glad,     themselves know more     than any  ."

    Nausicaa answered, "Stranger,   appear       sensible,
well disposed person.   is no accounting   luck; Jove gives
prosperity   rich   poor just     chooses,     must take

name   our people;   are called Phaeacians,     am daughter  
Alcinous,   whom   whole power     state is vested."

Then she called   maids   said, "Stay where   are,   girls.
Can     see   man without running away   him?     take him
    robber     murderer? Neither   nor any   else can come here
    us Phaeacians any harm,     are dear     gods,   live

  way,     must   kind   him,   strangers   foreigners
  distress are under Jove   protection,     take     can
      thankful;  , girls, give   poor fellow something  
eat   drink,   wash him     stream   some place   is sheltered
    wind." 

      maids left off running away   began calling   another
back.   made Ulysses sit down     shelter   Nausicaa had told
them,   brought him   shirt   cloak.   also brought him  
little golden cruse   oil,   told him     wash     stream.
But Ulysses said, "Young women, please   stand   little     side
    may wash   brine     shoulders   anoint myself  
oil,     is long enough since   skin has had   drop   oil upon
 .   cannot wash   long       keep standing  .   am ashamed
  strip before   number   good looking young women." 

Then   stood     side   went   tell   girl, while Ulysses
washed himself     stream   scrubbed   brine     back
      broad shoulders. When   had thoroughly washed himself,
  had got   brine       hair,   anointed himself   oil,
  put     clothes     girl had given him; Minerva then
made him look taller   stronger than before, she also made   hair
grow thick     top     head,   flow down   curls like hyacinth
blossoms; she glorified him     head   shoulders     skilful
workman   has studied art     kinds under Vulcan   Minerva
enriches   piece   silver plate   gilding  -     work is full
  beauty. Then   went   sat down   little way off upon   beach,
looking quite young   handsome,     girl gazed   him   admiration;
then she said     maids: 

"Hush,   dears,     want     something.   believe   gods  
live   heaven   sent   man     Phaeacians. When   first
saw him   thought him plain, but now   appearance is like    
  gods   dwell   heaven.   should like   future husband    
just such another     is,       only stay here     want
    away. However, give him something   eat   drink."

  did     were told,   set food before Ulysses,   ate  
drank ravenously,     was long since   had had food   any kind.
Meanwhile, Nausicaa bethought     another matter. She got   linen
folded   placed     waggon, she then yoked   mules,  ,  
she took   seat, she called Ulysses: 

"Stranger," said she, "rise   let us   going back     town;

Thus did   pray,   Minerva heard   prayer, but she

BOOK VII

Thus, then, did Ulysses wait   pray; but   girl drove      
town. When she reached   father   house she drew       gateway,
    brothers- comely     gods- gathered round  , took  
mules       waggon,   carried   clothes into   house, while
she went     own room, where   old servant, Eurymedusa   Apeira,
lit   fire    .   old woman had been brought   sea  
Apeira,   had been chosen     prize   Alcinous because   was
king over   Phaecians,     people obeyed him   though   were
  god. She had been nurse   Nausicaa,   had now lit   fire  
 ,   brought   supper     into   own room. 

Presently Ulysses got       towards   town;   Minerva shed
  thick mist   round him   hide him   case any     proud Phaecians
  met him should   rude   him,   ask him     was. Then,  
  was just entering   town, she came towards him     likeness
    little girl carrying   pitcher. She stood right   front   him,
  Ulysses said: 

"  dear,         kind     show     house   king Alcinous?
  am   unfortunate foreigner   distress,       know    
your town   country." 

Then Minerva said, "Yes, father stranger,     show     house
  want,   Alcinous lives quite close     own father.    
  before     show   way, but       word      ,  
    look   any man, nor ask him questions;     people here
cannot abide strangers,       like men   come   some other
place.   are   sea faring folk,   sail   seas     grace
  Neptune   ships   glide along like thought,       bird  
  air." 

    she led   way,   Ulysses followed     steps; but  
      Phaecians could see him     passed through   city  
  midst   them;     great goddess Minerva     good  
towards him had hidden him     thick cloud   darkness.   admired
  harbours, ships, places   assembly,     lofty walls  
  city,  ,     palisade   top   them, were very striking,
  when   reached   king   house Minerva said: 

"  is   house, father stranger,           show
 .     find   number   great people sitting   table, but
      afraid;   straight  ,     bolder   man is   more
likely   is   carry   point, even though   is   stranger. First
find   queen.   name is Arete,   she comes     same family
    husband Alcinous.   both descend originally   Neptune,
  was father   Nausithous   Periboea,   woman   great beauty.
Periboea was   youngest daughter   Eurymedon,       time reigned
over   giants, but   ruined   ill fated people   lost   own
life   boot. 

"Neptune, however, lay     daughter,   she had   son   him,
  great Nausithous,   reigned over   Phaecians. Nausithous had
two sons Rhexenor   Alcinous; Apollo killed   first   them while
  was still   bridegroom   without male issue; but   left   daughter
Arete, whom Alcinous married,   honours   no other woman is honoured
    those   keep house along     husbands. 

"Thus she both was,   still is, respected beyond measure    
children,   Alcinous himself,       whole people,   look upon
      goddess,   greet   whenever she goes     city,
  she is   thoroughly good woman both   head   heart,   when
any women are friends   hers, she   help   husbands also  
settle   disputes.     can gain   good  ,   may  
every hope   seeing your friends again,   getting safely back  
your home   country." 

Then Minerva left Scheria   went away over   sea. She went  
Marathon       spacious streets   Athens, where she entered
  abode   Erechtheus; but Ulysses went       house   Alcinous,
    pondered much     paused   while before reaching   threshold
  bronze,     splendour     palace was like       sun
  moon.   walls   either side were   bronze   end   end,
    cornice was   blue enamel.   doors were gold,   hung
  pillars   silver   rose     floor   bronze, while   lintel
was silver     hook     door was   gold. 

  either side   stood gold   silver mastiffs   Vulcan,
    consummate skill, had fashioned expressly   keep watch over
  palace   king Alcinous;     were immortal   could never
grow old. Seats were ranged   along   wall, here      
  end     other,   coverings   fine woven work    
women     house had made. Here   chief persons     Phaecians
used   sit   eat   drink,     was abundance     seasons;
    were golden figures   young men   lighted torches  
  hands, raised   pedestals,   give light   night   those
  were   table.   are fifty maid servants     house, some
  whom are always grinding rich yellow grain     mill, while others
work     loom,   sit   spin,     shuttles  , backwards
  forwards like   fluttering   aspen leaves, while   linen
is   closely woven       turn oil.     Phaecians are  
best sailors     world,     women excel   others   weaving,
  Minerva has taught them   manner   useful arts,     are
very intelligent. 

Outside   gate     outer court   is   large garden    
four acres     wall   round  .   is full   beautiful trees-
pears, pomegranates,     most delicious apples.   are luscious
figs also,   olives   full growth.   fruits never rot nor fail
    year round, neither winter nor summer,     air is   soft
    new crop ripens before   old has dropped. Pear grows   pear,
apple   apple,   fig   fig,     also     grapes,    
is   excellent vineyard:     level ground     part    ,  
grapes are being made into raisins;   another part   are being
gathered; some are being trodden     wine tubs, others further
    shed   blossom   are beginning   show fruit, others
again are just changing colour.     furthest part     ground
  are beautifully arranged beds   flowers   are   bloom  
  year round. Two streams   through  ,     turned   ducts
throughout   whole garden, while   other is carried under  
ground     outer court     house itself,     town   people
draw water    . Such, then, were   splendours      
gods had endowed   house   king Alcinous. 

  here Ulysses stood     while   looked   him, but when  
had looked long enough   crossed   threshold   went within  
precincts     house.     found     chief people among
  Phaecians making   drink offerings   Mercury,    
always did   last thing before going away     night.   went
straight through   court, still hidden     cloak   darkness
    Minerva had enveloped him, till   reached Arete   King
Alcinous; then   laid   hands upon   knees     queen,  
    moment   miraculous darkness fell away   him     became
visible. Every   was speechless   surprise   seeing   man  ,
but Ulysses began   once     petition. 

"Queen Arete,"   exclaimed, "daughter   great Rhexenor,     distress
  humbly pray  ,   also your husband   these your guests (whom
may heaven prosper   long life   happiness,   may   leave
  possessions     children,       honours conferred
upon them     state)   help   home     own country   soon
  possible;       been long   trouble   away     friends."

Then   sat down     hearth among   ashes       held  
peace, till presently   old hero Echeneus,   was   excellent
speaker     elder among   Phaeacians, plainly       honesty
addressed them thus: 

"Alcinous," said  , "  is   creditable         stranger
should   seen sitting among   ashes   your hearth; every   is
waiting   hear     are      ; tell him, then,   rise
  take   seat     stool inlaid   silver,   bid your servants
mix some wine   water     may make   drink offering   Jove
  lord   thunder,   takes   well disposed suppliants under
  protection;   let   housekeeper give him some supper,   whatever
  may       house." 

When Alcinous heard     took Ulysses     hand, raised him  
  hearth,   bade him take   seat   Laodamas,   had been sitting
beside him,   was   favourite son.   maid servant then brought
him water     beautiful golden ewer   poured   into   silver basin
  him   wash   hands,   she drew   clean table beside him;
  upper servant brought him bread   offered him many good things
      was     house,   Ulysses ate   drank. Then Alcinous
said         servants, "Pontonous, mix   cup   wine   hand
  round     may make drink offerings   Jove   lord   thunder,
  is   protector     well disposed suppliants." 

Pontonous then mixed wine   water,   handed   round after giving
every man   drink offering. When   had made   offerings,
  had drunk each   much     was minded, Alcinous said:

"Aldermen   town councillors     Phaeacians, hear   words.  
  had your supper,   now   home   bed.   morrow morning   shall
invite   still larger number   aldermen,     give   sacrificial
banquet   honour   our guest;   can then discuss   question  
  escort,   consider how   may   once send him back rejoicing
    own country without trouble   inconvenience   himself, no
matter how distant   may  .   must see     comes   no harm
while     homeward journey, but when   is once   home    
    take   luck   was born     better   worse like other
people.   is possible, however,     stranger is       immortals
  has come down   heaven   visit us; but     case   gods
are departing     usual practice,   hitherto     made
themselves perfectly clear   us when     been offering them hecatombs.
  come   sit   our feasts just like     our selves,    
any solitary wayfarer happens   stumble upon some     other  
them,   affect no concealment,     are   near   kin    
gods     Cyclopes     savage giants are." 

Then Ulysses said: "Pray, Alcinous,     take any such notion into
your head.     nothing     immortal    , neither   body
nor mind,   most resemble those among     are   most afflicted.
Indeed, were     tell       heaven has seen fit   lay upon
 ,           was still worse off than   are. Nevertheless,
let   sup   spite   sorrow,     empty stomach is   very importunate
thing,   thrusts itself     man   notice no matter how dire is
  distress.   am   great trouble, yet   insists     shall eat
  drink, bids   lay aside   memory     sorrows   dwell only
    due replenishing   itself.     yourselves,       propose,
    break   day set   helping       home.   shall   content
  die     may first once more behold   property,   bondsmen,  
    greatness     house." 

Thus did   speak. Every   approved   saying,   agreed  
  should     escort inasmuch     had spoken reasonably. Then
when   had made   drink offerings,   had drunk each   much
    was minded   went home   bed every man     own abode,
leaving Ulysses     cloister   Arete   Alcinous while  
servants were taking   things away after supper. Arete was   first
  speak,   she recognized   shirt, cloak,   good clothes  
Ulysses was wearing,     work   herself       maids;   she
said, "Stranger, before     any further,   is   question   should
like   ask  .  ,   whence are  ,     gave   those clothes?
Did         had come here   beyond   sea?" 

  Ulysses answered, "        long story Madam, were     relate
  full   tale     misfortunes,     hand   heaven has been
laid heavy upon  ; but   regards your question,   is   island
far away     sea   is called '  Ogygian.' Here dwells  
cunning   powerful goddess Calypso, daughter   Atlas. She lives
  herself far     neighbours human   divine. Fortune, however,
      hearth   desolate   alone,   Jove struck   ship  
  thunderbolts,   broke       mid ocean.   brave comrades
were drowned every man   them, but   stuck     keel   was carried
hither   thither     space   nine days, till   last during
  darkness     tenth night   gods brought       Ogygian
island where   great goddess Calypso lives. She took       treated
      utmost kindness; indeed she wanted   make   immortal
    might never grow old, but she could   persuade     let
     . 

"  stayed   Calypso seven years straight   end,   watered  
good clothes she gave       tears during   whole time; but
  last when   eighth year came round she bade   depart    
own free  , either because Jove had told   she must,   because
she had changed   mind. She sent       island     raft,  
she provisioned   abundance   bread   wine. Moreover she gave
  good stout clothing,   sent     wind   blew both warm  
fair. Days seven   ten did   sail over   sea,       eighteenth
  caught sight     first outlines     mountains upon your coast-
  glad indeed was     set eyes upon them. Nevertheless   was
still much trouble   store    ,       point Neptune  
let     no further,   raised   great storm against  ;   sea
was   terribly high     could no longer keep     raft,  
went   pieces under   fury     gale,     had   swim    ,
till wind   current brought     your shores. 

"    tried   land, but could  ,     was   bad place  
  waves dashed   against   rocks,     again took     sea
  swam   till   came     river   seemed   most likely landing
place,     were no rocks     was sheltered     wind.
Here, then,   got       water   gathered   senses together
again. Night was coming  ,     left   river,   went into   thicket,
where   covered myself   over   leaves,   presently heaven
sent   off into   very deep sleep. Sick   sorry     was   slept
among   leaves   night,   through   next day till afternoon,
when   woke     sun was westering,   saw your daughter   maid
servants playing upon   beach,   your daughter among them looking
like   goddess.   besought   aid,   she proved         excellent
disposition, much more   than could   expected     young   person-
  young people are apt     thoughtless. She gave   plenty  
bread   wine,   when she had had   washed     river she also
gave     clothes       see  . Now, therefore, though  
has pained        ,     told     whole truth."

Then Alcinous said, "Stranger,   was very wrong     daughter  
  bring       once     house along     maids, seeing  
she was   first person whose aid   asked." 

"Pray     scold  ," replied Ulysses; "she is     blame. She
did tell     follow along     maids, but   was ashamed  
afraid,     thought   might perhaps   displeased     saw  .
Every human being is sometimes   little suspicious   irritable."

"Stranger," replied Alcinous, "  am     kind   man     angry
  nothing;   is always better     reasonable; but   Father
Jove, Minerva,   Apollo, now     see   kind   person  
are,   how much   think      ,   wish     stay here, marry
  daughter,   become   son   law.       stay     give
    house     estate, but no   (heaven forbid) shall keep  
here against your own wish,       may   sure        
attend   morrow     matter   your escort.   can sleep during
  whole voyage     like,     men shall sail   over smooth
waters either   your own home,   wherever   please, even though
      long way further off than Euboea,   those     people
  saw   when   took yellow haired Rhadamanthus   see Tityus
  son   Gaia, tell   is   furthest   any place-   yet  
did   whole voyage     single day without distressing themselves,
  came back again afterwards.     thus see how much   ships
excel   others,     magnificent oarsmen   sailors are."

Then was Ulysses glad   prayed aloud saying, "Father Jove, grant
  Alcinous may         has said,         win   imperishable
name among mankind,       same time   shall return     country."

Thus did   converse. Then Arete told   maids   set   bed  
  room   was     gatehouse,   make     good red rugs,
    spread coverlets     top   them   woollen cloaks  
Ulysses   wear.   maids thereon went     torches    
hands,   when   had made   bed   came     Ulysses  
said, "Rise, sir stranger,   come   us   your bed is ready,"
  glad indeed was           rest. 

  Ulysses slept     bed placed     room over   echoing gateway;
but Alcinous lay     inner part     house,     queen  
wife     side.

BOOK VIII

Now when   child   morning, rosy fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous
  Ulysses both rose,   Alcinous led   way     Phaecian place
  assembly,   was near   ships. When   got     sat
down side   side     seat   polished stone, while Minerva took
  form       Alcinous' servants,   went round   town  
order   help Ulysses     home. She went       citizens, man
  man,   said, "Aldermen   town councillors     Phaeacians,
come     assembly         listen     stranger   has
just come off   long voyage     house   King Alcinous;   looks
like   immortal god." 

  these words she made them   want   come,     flocked
    assembly till seats   standing room were alike crowded. Every
  was struck     appearance   Ulysses,   Minerva had beautified
him     head   shoulders, making him look taller   stouter
than   really was,     might impress   Phaecians favourably
  being   very remarkable man,   might come off well     many
trials   skill         challenge him. Then, when  
were got together, Alcinous spoke: 

"Hear  ," said  , "aldermen   town councillors     Phaeacians,
    may speak even     am minded.   stranger, whoever   may
 , has found   way     house   somewhere   other either East
  West.   wants   escort   wishes       matter settled.
Let us then     ready   him,       done   others before
him; indeed, no     ever yet came     house has been able  
complain         speeding     way soon enough. Let us draw
  ship into   sea-     has never yet made   voyage-   man
    two   fifty   our smartest young sailors. Then when  
  made fast your oars each     own seat, leave   ship

  am giving   these instructions     young men     form

join     entertaining our guest     cloisters.   can take no
excuses,         Demodocus   sing   us;     is no
bard like him whatever   may choose   sing  ." 

Alcinous then led   way,     others followed after, while  
servant went   fetch Demodocus.   fifty two picked oarsmen went
    sea shore     had been told,   when   got    
drew   ship into   water, got   mast   sails inside  , bound

  little way     land,   then came   shore   went    
house   King Alcinous.   outhouses, yards,       precincts
were filled   crowds   men   great multitudes both old   young;
  Alcinous killed them   dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs,  
two oxen. These   skinned   dressed       provide   magnificent
banquet. 

  servant presently led     famous bard Demodocus, whom   muse
had dearly loved, but   whom she had given both good   evil,  
though she had endowed him     divine gift   song, she had robbed
him     eyesight. Pontonous set   seat   him among   guests,
leaning     against   bearing post.   hung   lyre   him  
  peg over   head,   showed him where   was   feel      
  hands.   also set   fair table     basket   victuals    
side,     cup   wine       might drink whenever   was
  disposed. 

  company then laid   hands upon   good things   were before
them, but   soon     had had enough   eat   drink,   muse
inspired Demodocus   sing   feats   heroes,   more especially
  matter   was then     mouths     men,   wit,   quarrel
between Ulysses   Achilles,     fierce words     heaped
    another     gat together     banquet. But Agamemnon was
glad when   heard   chieftains quarrelling     another,  
Apollo had foretold him     Pytho when   crossed   stone floor
  consult   oracle. Here was   beginning     evil    
      Jove fell both Danaans   Trojans. 

Thus sang   bard, but Ulysses drew   purple mantle over   head
  covered   face,     was ashamed   let   Phaeacians see
    was weeping. When   bard left off singing   wiped   tears
    eyes, uncovered   face,  , taking   cup, made   drink offering
    gods; but when   Phaeacians pressed Demodocus   sing further,
    delighted     lays, then Ulysses again drew   mantle
over   head   wept bitterly. No   noticed   distress except
Alcinous,   was sitting near him,   heard   heavy sighs  
  was heaving.       once said, "Aldermen   town councillors
    Phaeacians,     had enough now, both     feast,  
    minstrelsy   is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore
    athletic sports,     our guest     return home may  
able   tell   friends how much   surpass   other nations  
boxers, wrestlers, jumpers,   runners." 

  these words   led   way,     others followed after.  
servant hung Demodocus   lyre   its peg   him, led him      
cloister,   set him     same way     along      
chief men     Phaeacians were going   see   sports;   crowd
  several thousands   people followed them,     were many
excellent competitors       prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus,
Nauteus, Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineus,
  Amphialus son   Polyneus son   Tecton.   was also Euryalus
son   Naubolus,   was like Mars himself,   was   best looking
man among   Phaecians except Laodamas. Three sons   Alcinous, Laodamas,
Halios,   Clytoneus, competed also. 

  foot races came first.   course was set     them    
starting post,     raised   dust upon   plain       flew
forward     same moment. Clytoneus came   first     long way;
  left every   else behind him     length     furrow  
  couple   mules can plough     fallow field.   then turned  
  painful art   wrestling,   here Euryalus proved       best
man. Amphialus excelled     others   jumping, while   throwing
  disc   was no     could approach Elatreus. Alcinous  
son Laodamas was   best boxer,       was   presently said,
when   had   been diverted     games, "Let us ask   stranger
whether   excels   any   these sports;   seems very powerfully
built;   thighs, claves, hands,   neck are   prodigious strength,
nor is       old, but   has suffered much lately,     is
nothing like   sea   making havoc     man, no matter how strong
  is." 

"  are quite right, Laodamas," replied Euryalus, "      your
guest   speak   him     yourself." 

When Laodamas heard     made   way into   middle     crowd
  said   Ulysses, "  hope, Sir,       enter yourself  
some     other   our competitions     are skilled   any  
them-     must   gone     many     before now.   is
nothing   does any     much credit     life long    
showing himself   proper man     hands   feet.     try therefore
  something,   banish   sorrow   your mind. Your return home
      long delayed,     ship is already drawn into   water,
    crew is found." 

Ulysses answered, "Laodamas, why     taunt       way?   mind
is set rather   cares than contests;     been through infinite
trouble,   am come among   now     suppliant, praying your king
  people   further       return home." 

Then Euryalus reviled him outright   said, "  gather, then,  
  are unskilled   any     many sports   men generally delight
 .   suppose   are     those grasping traders      
  ships   captains   merchants,     think   nothing but  
  outward freights   homeward cargoes.   does   seem  
  much     athlete    ." 

"  shame, Sir," answered Ulysses, fiercely, "  are   insolent
fellow-   true is       gods     grace   men alike  
speech, person,   understanding.   man may     weak presence,
but heaven has adorned     such   good conversation    
charms every     sees him;   honeyed moderation carries  
hearers   him       is leader     assemblies     fellows,
  wherever   goes   is looked    . Another may     handsome
    god, but   good looks are   crowned   discretion.  
is your case. No god could make   finer looking fellow than   are,
but   are   fool. Your ill judged remarks   made   exceedingly
angry,     are quite mistaken,     excel     great many athletic
exercises; indeed,   long     had youth   strength,   was among
  first athletes     age. Now, however,   am worn     labour
  sorrow,       gone through much both     field   battle
      waves     weary sea; still,   spite          
compete,   your taunts   stung       quick." 

    hurried   without even taking   cloak off,   seized   disc,
larger, more massive   much heavier than those used     Phaeacians
when disc throwing among themselves. Then, swinging   back,   threw
      brawny hand,     made   humming sound     air  
  did  .   Phaeacians quailed beneath   rushing   its flight
    sped gracefully     hand,   flew beyond any mark  
had been made yet. Minerva,     form     man, came   marked
  place where   had fallen. "  blind man, Sir," said she, "could
easily tell your mark   groping    -   is   far ahead   any
other.   may make your mind easy     contest,   no Phaeacian
can come near   such   throw   yours." 

Ulysses was glad when   found   had   friend among   lookers  ,
    began   speak more pleasantly. "Young men," said  , "come
      throw     can,       throw another disc   heavy
  even heavier.   anyone wants       bout     let him come
 ,     am exceedingly angry;     box, wrestle,   run,    
  care     is,   any man       except Laodamas, but
    him because   am   guest,     cannot compete      
own personal friend.   least       think     prudent     sensible
thing     guest   challenge   host   family   any game, especially
when   is     foreign country.     cut   ground   under
  own feet     does; but   make no exception   regards any  
else,     want       matter     know   is   best
man.   am   good hand   every kind   athletic sport known among
mankind.   am   excellent archer.   battle   am always   first
  bring   man down     arrow, no matter how many more are taking
aim   him alongside    . Philoctetes was   only man   could
shoot better than   could when   Achaeans were before Troy    
practice.   far excel every   else     whole world,   those
  still eat bread upon   face     earth, but   should   like
  shoot against   mighty dead, such   Hercules,   Eurytus  
Cechalian men   could shoot against   gods themselves.    
fact was how Eurytus came prematurely     end,   Apollo was angry
  him   killed him because   challenged him     archer.  
can throw   dart farther than any   else can shoot   arrow. Running
is   only point   respect       am afraid some     Phaecians
might beat  ,       been brought down very low   sea;   provisions
ran short,   therefore   am still weak." 

    held   peace except King Alcinous,   began, "Sir,  
  had much pleasure   hearing         told us,  
    understand     are willing   show your prowess,   having
been displeased   some insolent remarks     been made  
        our athletes,     could never   been uttered
  any     knows how   talk   propriety.   hope     apprehend
  meaning,     explain   any       your chief men   may
  dining   yourself   your family when     home,    
    hereditary aptitude   accomplishments     kinds.   are
  particularly remarkable   our boxing, nor yet   wrestlers,
but   are singularly fleet   foot   are excellent sailors.  
are extremely fond   good dinners, music,   dancing;   also like
frequent changes   linen, warm baths,   good beds,   now, please,
some       are   best dancers set   dancing,   our guest
    return home may   able   tell   friends how much   surpass
  other nations   sailors, runners, dancers, minstrels. Demodocus
has left   lyre     house,   run some     other      
fetch     him." 

      servant hurried off   bring   lyre     king   house,
    nine men   had been chosen   stewards stood forward.  
was   business   manage everything connected     sports,
    made   ground smooth   marked   wide space     dancers.
Presently   servant came back   Demodocus   lyre,     took
  place     midst   them, whereon   best young dancers  
  town began   foot   trip     nimbly   Ulysses was delighted
    merry twinkling     feet. 

Meanwhile   bard began   sing   loves   Mars   Venus,  
how   first began   intrigue     house   Vulcan. Mars made
Venus many presents,   defiled King Vulcan   marriage bed,    
sun,   saw     were  , told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry
when   heard such dreadful news,     went     smithy brooding
mischief, got   great anvil into its place,   began   forge some
chains   none could either unloose   break,       might
stay       place. When   had finished   snare   went into
  bedroom   festooned   bed posts   over   chains like
cobwebs;   also let many hang down     great beam     ceiling.
  even   god could see them,   fine   subtle were  .   soon
    had spread   chains   over   bed,   made   though  
were setting       fair state   Lemnos,       places
    world was       was most fond  . But Mars kept no blind
look  ,     soon     saw him start, hurried off     house,
burning   love   Venus. 

Now Venus was just come       visit     father Jove,   was
  sitting down when Mars came inside   house,   said    
took   hand     own, "Let us       couch   Vulcan:   is
    home, but is gone off   Lemnos among   Sintians, whose speech
is barbarous." 

She was nothing loth,     went     couch   take   rest,
whereon   were caught     toils   cunning Vulcan had spread
  them,   could neither     nor stir hand   foot, but found
too late     were     trap. Then Vulcan came     them,  
  had turned back before reaching Lemnos, when   scout   sun
told him   was going  .   was     furious passion,   stood
    vestibule making   dreadful noise     shouted      
gods. 

"Father Jove,"   cried, "      other blessed gods   live
  ever, come here   see   ridiculous   disgraceful sight  
    show  . Jove   daughter Venus is always dishonouring   because
  am lame. She is   love   Mars,   is handsome   clean built,
whereas   am   cripple- but   parents are   blame    ,  
 ;   ought never     begotten  . Come   see   pair together
asleep     bed.   makes   furious   look   them.   are very
fond     another, but       think     lie   longer
than   can help, nor     think       sleep much;  ,
however,   shall stay till   father has repaid     sum   gave
him     baggage     daughter,   is fair but   honest."

      gods gathered     house   Vulcan. Earth encircling
Neptune came,   Mercury   bringer   luck,   King Apollo, but
  goddesses stayed   home     them   shame. Then   givers
    good things stood     doorway,     blessed gods roared
  inextinguishable laughter,     saw how cunning Vulcan had
been, whereon     turn towards   neighbour saying:

"Ill deeds     prosper,     weak confound   strong. See how
limping Vulcan, lame     is, has caught Mars   is   fleetest
god   heaven;   now Mars     cast   heavy damages."

Thus did   converse, but King Apollo said   Mercury, "Messenger
Mercury, giver   good things,       care how strong   chains
were,    ,     could sleep   Venus?" 

"King Apollo," answered Mercury, "  only wish   might     chance,
though   were three times   many chains-     might look  ,
     , gods   goddesses, but   sleep         could."

  immortal gods burst   laughing     heard him, but Neptune
took     seriously,   kept   imploring Vulcan   set Mars free
again. "Let him  ,"   cried, "      undertake,     require,
    shall pay       damages   are held reasonable among
  immortal gods." 

"   ," replied Vulcan, "ask        ;   bad man   bond is
bad security;   remedy could   enforce against     Mars should
  away   leave   debts behind him along     chains?"

"Vulcan," said Neptune, "  Mars goes away without paying   damages,
    pay   myself."   Vulcan answered, "    case   cannot
  must   refuse  ." 

Thereon   loosed   bonds   bound them,     soon     were
free   scampered off, Mars   Thrace   laughter loving Venus
  Cyprus     Paphos, where is   grove     altar fragrant
  burnt offerings. Here   Graces hathed  ,   anointed  
  oil   ambrosia such     immortal gods make use  ,    
clothed     raiment     most enchanting beauty. 

Thus sang   bard,   both Ulysses     seafaring Phaeacians
were charmed     heard him. 

Then Alcinous told Laodamas   Halius   dance alone,     was
no     compete   them.     took   red ball   Polybus
had made   them,       them bent himself backwards   threw
    towards   clouds, while   other jumped   off   ground
  caught     ease before   came down again. When   had done
throwing   ball straight   into   air   began   dance,  
    same time kept   throwing   backwards   forwards    
another, while     young men     ring applauded   made  
great stamping     feet. Then Ulysses said: 

"King Alcinous,   said your people were   nimblest dancers  
  world,   indeed     proved themselves      .   was
astonished     saw them." 

  king was delighted    ,   exclaimed     Phaecians "Aldermen
  town councillors, our guest seems       person   singular judgement;
let us give him such proof   our hospitality     may reasonably
expect.   are twelve chief men among  ,   counting myself
  are thirteen; contribute, each    ,   clean cloak,   shirt,
    talent   fine gold; let us give him         lump down
  once,     when   gets   supper   may         light
heart.     Euryalus         make   formal apology    
present too,     has been rude." 

Thus did   speak.   others     them applauded   saying,  
sent   servants   fetch   presents. Then Euryalus said, "King
Alcinous,     give   stranger     satisfaction   require.
  shall   sword,   is   bronze,   but   hilt,   is
  silver.     also give him   scabbard   newly sawn ivory into
    fits.       worth   great deal   him." 

    spoke   placed   sword     hands   Ulysses   said,
"Good luck    , father stranger;   anything has been said amiss
may   winds blow   away   them,   may heaven grant     safe
return,     understand     been long away   home,    
gone through much hardship." 

    Ulysses answered, "Good luck     too   friend,   may
  gods grant   every happiness.   hope       miss   sword
    given   along   your apology." 

  these words   girded   sword     shoulders   towards
sundown   presents began   make   appearance,     servants
    donors kept bringing them     house   King Alcinous; here
  sons received them,   placed them under   mother   charge.
Then Alcinous led   way     house   bade   guests take  
seats. 

"Wife," said  , turning   Queen Arete, " , fetch   best chest
   ,   put   clean cloak   shirt    . Also, set   copper
    fire   heat some water; our guest   take   warm bath;
see also     careful packing     presents     noble Phaeacians
  made him;     thus better enjoy both   supper     singing
    follow.   shall myself give him   golden goblet-  
is   exquisite workmanship-     may   reminded        
rest     life whenever   makes   drink offering   Jove,    
any     gods." 

Then Arete told   maids   set   large tripod upon   fire   fast
    could, whereon   set   tripod full   bath water    
  clear fire;   threw   sticks   make   blaze,     water
became hot     flame played     belly     tripod. Meanwhile
Arete brought   magnificent chest   own room,   inside   she
packed     beautiful presents   gold   raiment     Phaeacians
had brought. Lastly she added   cloak     good shirt   Alcinous,
  said   Ulysses: 

"See     lid yourself,       whole bound round   once,
  fear any   should rob       way when   are asleep  
your ship." 

When Ulysses heard     put   lid     chest   made   fast
    bond   Circe had taught him.   had done   before   upper
servant told him   come     bath   wash himself.   was very
glad     warm bath,     had had no     wait upon him ever since
  left   house   Calypso,     long     remained    
had taken   good care   him   though   had been   god. When  
servants had done washing   anointing him   oil,   had given
him   clean cloak   shirt,   left   bath room   joined  
guests   were sitting over   wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood  
      bearing posts supporting   roof     cloister,  
admired him   she saw him pass. "Farewell stranger," said she, " 
  forget   when   are safe   home again,     is     first
    owe   ransom   having saved your life." 

  Ulysses said, "Nausicaa, daughter   great Alcinous, may Jove
  mighty husband   Juno, grant     may reach   home;   shall
  bless       guardian angel     days,     was     saved
 ." 

When   had said  ,   seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was
then served,     wine was mixed   drinking.   servant led  
  favourite bard Demodocus,   set him     midst     company,
near       bearing posts supporting   cloister,     might
lean against  . Then Ulysses cut off   piece   roast pork   plenty
  fat (    was abundance left     joint)   said     servant,
"Take   piece   pork over   Demodocus   tell him   eat  ;
      pain   lays may cause       salute him none  
less; bards are honoured   respected throughout   world,    
muse teaches them   songs   loves them." 

  servant carried   pork     fingers over   Demodocus,  
took     was very much pleased.   then laid   hands    
good things   were before them,     soon     had had  
eat   drink, Ulysses said   Demodocus, "Demodocus,   is no
      world whom   admire more than      .   must   studied
under   Muse, Jove   daughter,   under Apollo,   accurately  
  sing   return     Achaeans       sufferings  
adventures.     were     yourself,   must   heard  
    some     was. Now, however, change your song   tell
us     wooden horse   Epeus made     assistance   Minerva,
    Ulysses got   stratagem into   fort   Troy after freighting
      men   afterwards sacked   city.       sing  
tale aright     tell     world how magnificently heaven has
endowed  ." 

  bard inspired   heaven took     story     point where some
    Argives set fire     tents   sailed away while others,
hidden within   horse, were waiting   Ulysses     Trojan place
  assembly.     Trojans themselves had drawn   horse into  
fortress,     stood   while   sat   council round  ,  
were   three minds         should  . Some were   breaking
    then    ; others       dragged     top    
rock       fortress stood,   then thrown down   precipice;
while yet others were   letting   remain     offering   propitiation
    gods.     was how   settled       end,    
city was doomed when   took     horse, within   were  
  bravest     Argives waiting   bring death   destruction
    Trojans. Anon   sang how   sons     Achaeans issued  
  horse,   sacked   town, breaking       ambuscade.
  sang how   over ran   city hither   thither   ravaged
 ,   how Ulysses went raging like Mars along   Menelaus    
house   Deiphobus.   was       fight raged most furiously,
nevertheless   Minerva   help   was victorious. 

      told, but Ulysses was overcome     heard him,    
cheeks were wet   tears.   wept     woman weeps when she throws
herself     body     husband   has fallen before   own city
  people, fighting bravely   defence     home   children.
She screams aloud   flings   arms   him     lies gasping
  breath   dying, but   enemies beat     behind    
back   shoulders,   carry   off into slavery,     life   labour
  sorrow,     beauty fades     cheeks- even   piteously
did Ulysses weep, but none   those present perceived   tears except
Alcinous,   was sitting near him,   could hear   sobs   sighs
    was heaving.   king, therefore,   once rose   said:

"Aldermen   town councillors     Phaeacians, let Demodocus cease
  song,     are those present       seem   like  .
    moment     had done supper   Demodocus began   sing,
our guest has been     time groaning   lamenting.   is evidently
  great trouble,   let   bard leave off,     may   enjoy
ourselves, hosts   guest alike.       much more     should
 ,     these festivities,     escort     presents  
  are making     much good  , are wholly     honour,  
any     even   moderate amount   right feeling knows    
ought   treat   guest     suppliant   though   were   own brother.

"When   had set sail thence   wind took   first   Ismarus,  
is   city     Cicons.     sacked   town   put   people
    sword.   took   wives   also much booty,     divided
equitably amongst us,     none might   reason   complain.
  then said     had better make off   once, but   men very foolishly
    obey  ,     stayed   drinking much wine   killing
great numbers   sheep   oxen     sea shore. Meanwhile   Cicons
cried     help   other Cicons   lived inland. These were more
  number,   stronger,     were more skilled     art  
war,     could fight, either   chariots     foot    
occasion served;     morning, therefore,   came   thick  
leaves   bloom   summer,     hand   heaven was against us,
      were hard pressed.   set   battle   array near  
ships,     hosts aimed   bronze shod spears     another.
  long     day waxed     was still morning,   held our own
against them, though   were more   number than  ; but    
sun went down, towards   time when men loose   oxen,   Cicons
got   better   us,     lost half   dozen men   every ship
  had;     got away   those   were left. 

"Thence   sailed onward   sorrow   our hearts, but glad    
escaped death though   had lost our comrades, nor did   leave till
  had thrice invoked each       poor fellows   had perished
    hands     Cicons. Then Jove raised   North wind against
us till   blew   hurricane,     land   sky were hidden   thick
clouds,   night sprang forth       heavens.   let   ships
run before   gale, but   force     wind tore our sails   tatters,
    took them down   fear   shipwreck,   rowed our hardest
towards   land.     lay two days   two nights suffering much
alike   toil   distress   mind, but     morning     third
day   again raised our masts, set sail,   took our places, letting
  wind   steersmen direct our ship.   should   got home  
  time unharmed had     North wind     currents been against

  island   Cythera. 

"  was driven thence   foul winds     space   nine days upon  
sea, but     tenth day   reached   land     Lotus eater,
  live     food   comes     kind   flower. Here   landed
  take   fresh water,   our crews got   mid day meal    
shore near   ships. When   had eaten   drunk   sent two  
  company   see   manner   men   people     place might
 ,     had   third man under them.   started   once,  
went   among   Lotus eaters,   did them no hurt, but gave
them   eat     lotus,   was   delicious   those   ate
    left off caring   home,   did   even want     back
      had happened   them, but were   staying   munching
lotus     Lotus eater without thinking further     return;
nevertheless, though   wept bitterly   forced them back    
ships   made them fast under   benches. Then   told   rest  
    board   once, lest any   them should taste     lotus  
leave off wanting     home,     took   places   smote

"  sailed hence, always   much distress, till   came     land
    lawless   inhuman Cyclopes. Now   Cyclopes neither plant
nor plough, but trust   providence,   live   such wheat, barley,
  grapes   grow wild without any kind   tillage,     wild
grapes yield them wine     sun     rain may grow them.  
  no laws nor assemblies     people, but live   caves    
tops   high mountains; each is lord   master     family,  
  take no account     neighbours. 

"Now off   harbour   lies   wooded   fertile island  
quite close     land     Cyclopes, but still   far.   is
overrun   wild goats,   breed     great numbers   are
never disturbed   foot   man;   sportsmen-       rule  
suffer   much hardship   forest   among mountain precipices-  
     , nor yet again is   ever ploughed   fed down, but  
lies   wilderness untilled   unsown   year   year,   has no
living thing upon   but only goats.     Cyclopes   no ships,
nor yet shipwrights   could make ships   them;   cannot therefore
    city   city,   sail over   sea     another   country
  people     ships can  ;     had had these    
  colonized   island,     is   very good  ,     yield
everything   due season.   are meadows     some places come
right down     sea shore, well watered   full   luscious grass;
grapes       excellently;   is level land   ploughing,
      always yield heavily   harvest time,     soil is
deep.   is   good harbour where no cables are wanted, nor yet
anchors, nor need   ship   moored, but     has     is   beach

    sea again.     head     harbour   is   spring  
clear water coming       cave,     are poplars growing  
round  . 

"Here   entered, but   dark was   night   some god must  
brought us  ,     was nothing whatever     seen.   thick
mist hung   round our ships;   moon was hidden behind   mass  
clouds     no   could   seen   island     had looked
   , nor were   any breakers   tell us   were close   shore
before   found ourselves upon   land itself; when, however,  
had beached   ships,   took down   sails, went ashore   camped
upon   beach till daybreak. 

"When   child   morning, rosy fingered Dawn, appeared,   admired
  island   wandered   over  , while   nymphs Jove   daughters
roused   wild goats     might   some meat   our dinner.
      fetched our spears   bows   arrows     ships,
  dividing ourselves into three bands began   shoot   goats.
Heaven sent us excellent sport;   had twelve ships    ,   each
ship got nine goats, while   own ship had ten; thus through   livelong
day     going down     sun   ate   drank our fill,-    
had plenty   wine left,   each     us had taken many jars full
when   sacked   city     Cicons,     had   yet run  .
While   were feasting   kept turning our eyes towards   land  
  Cyclopes,   was hard  ,   saw   smoke     stubble
fires.   could almost fancy   heard   voices     bleating
    sheep   goats, but when   sun went down     came  
dark,   camped down upon   beach,   next morning   called   council.

"'Stay here,   brave fellows,' said  , '    rest    , while
        ship   exploit these people myself:   want   see  
  are uncivilized savages,     hospitable   humane race.'

"  went   board, bidding   men       also   loose   hawsers;
    took   places   smote   grey sea     oars.
When   got     land,   was   far,  ,     face  
  cliff near   sea,   saw   great cave overhung   laurels.  
was   station     great many sheep   goats,   outside  
was   large yard,     high wall round   made   stones built into
  ground     trees both pine   oak.   was   abode    
huge monster   was then away   home shepherding   flocks.  
    nothing       other people, but led   life    
outlaw.   was   horrid creature,   like   human being    , but
resembling rather some crag   stands   boldly against   sky
    top     high mountain. 

"  told   men   draw   ship ashore,   stay where   were,
  but   twelve best among them,   were     along   myself.
  also took   goatskin   sweet black wine   had been given  
  Maron, Apollo son   Euanthes,   was priest   Apollo   patron
god   Ismarus,   lived within   wooded precincts     temple.
When   were sacking   city   respected him,   spared   life,
  also   wife   child;     made   some presents   great value-
seven talents   fine gold,     bowl   silver,   twelve jars
  sweet wine, unblended,       most exquisite flavour.    
man nor maid     house knew    , but only himself,   wife,
    housekeeper: when   drank     mixed twenty parts   water
      wine,   yet   fragrance     mixing bowl was  
exquisite     was impossible   refrain   drinking.   filled
  large skin     wine,   took   wallet full   provisions
   ,     mind misgave       might     deal   some
savage         great strength,     respect neither right
nor law. 

"  soon reached   cave, but   was   shepherding,     went
inside   took stock         could see.   cheese racks were
loaded   cheeses,     had more lambs   kids than   pens
could hold.   were kept   separate flocks; first   were  
hoggets, then   oldest     younger lambs   lastly   very
young ones   kept apart     another;       dairy,  
  vessels, bowls,   milk pails into     milked, were swimming
  whey. When   saw    ,   men begged     let them first
steal some cheeses,   make off   them     ship;    
then return, drive down   lambs   kids, put them   board  
sail away   them.       been indeed better     had done
  but       listen   them,     wanted   see   owner himself,
    hope     might give     present. When, however,   saw
him   poor men found him ill   deal  . 

"  lit   fire, offered some     cheeses   sacrifice, ate others
  them,   then sat waiting till   Cyclops should come    
  sheep. When   came,   brought     him   huge load   dry
firewood   light   fire     supper,       flung  
such   noise       floor     cave     hid ourselves  
fear     far end     cavern. Meanwhile   drove     ewes
inside,   well     she goats     was going   milk, leaving
  males, both rams     goats, outside     yards. Then   rolled
  huge stone     mouth     cave-   huge   two   twenty
strong four wheeled waggons       enough   draw     its
place against   doorway. When   had   done   sat down   milked
  ewes   goats,     due course,   then let each   them  
  own young.   curdled half   milk   set   aside   wicker
strainers, but   other half   poured into bowls     might drink
      supper. When   had got through       work,   lit
  fire,   then caught sight   us, whereon   said: 

"'Strangers,   are  ? Where   sail  ? Are   traders,  
    sail     rovers,   your hands against every man,  
every man   hand against  ?' 

"  were frightened     our senses     loud voice   monstrous
form, but   managed    , '  are Achaeans   our way home  
Troy, but         Jove,   stress   weather,     been
driven far     our course.   are   people   Agamemnon, son
  Atreus,   has won infinite renown throughout   whole world,
  sacking   great   city   killing   many people.   therefore
humbly pray     show us some hospitality,   otherwise make us
such presents   visitors may reasonably expect. May your excellency
fear   wrath   heaven,     are your suppliants,   Jove takes
  respectable travellers under   protection,     is   avenger
    suppliants   foreigners   distress.' 

"      gave   but   pitiless answer, 'Stranger,' said  , ' 
are   fool,   else   know nothing     country. Talk    ,
indeed,   fearing   gods   shunning   anger?   Cyclopes
    care   Jove   any   your blessed gods,     are ever
  much stronger than  .   shall   spare either yourself   your
companions     any regard   Jove, unless   am     humour  
doing  .   now tell   where   made your ship fast when   came
  shore. Was   round   point,   is she lying straight off  
land?' 

"  said     draw    , but   was too cunning     caught  
  way,     answered     lie; 'Neptune,' said  , 'sent   ship
      rocks     far end   your country,   wrecked  .  
were driven     them     open sea, but     those   are
    escaped   jaws   death.' 

"  cruel wretch vouchsafed       word   answer, but    
sudden clutch   gripped   two     men   once   dashed them
down upon   ground   though   had been puppies.   brains
were shed upon   ground,     earth was wet     blood.
Then   tore them limb   limb   supped upon them.   gobbled
them   like   lion     wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow,   entrails,
without leaving anything uneaten.     us,   wept   lifted  
our hands   heaven   seeing such   horrid sight,     did  
know   else    ; but when   Cyclops had filled   huge paunch,
  had washed down   meal   human flesh     drink   neat milk,
  stretched himself full length upon   ground among   sheep,
  went   sleep.   was   first inclined   seize   sword, draw
 ,   drive   into   vitals, but   reflected       did  
should   certainly   lost,     should never   able   shift
  stone     monster had put   front     door.     stayed
sobbing   sighing where   were till morning came. 

"When   child   morning, rosy fingered Dawn, appeared,   again
lit   fire, milked   goats   ewes,   quite rightly,   then
let each     own young  ;   soon     had got through  
    work,   clutched   two more     men,   began eating
them     morning   meal. Presently,     utmost ease,   rolled
  stone away     door   drove     sheep, but     once
put   back again-   easily   though   were merely clapping  
lid       quiver full   arrows.   soon     had done     shouted,
  cried 'Shoo, shoo,' after   sheep   drive them       mountain;
    was left   scheme some way   taking   revenge   covering
myself   glory. 

"    end   deemed         best plan       follows.  
Cyclops had   great club   was lying near       sheep pens;
  was   green olive wood,     had cut   intending   use  
    staff   soon     should   dry.   was   huge     could
only compare       mast     twenty oared merchant vessel   large
burden,   able   venture   into open sea.   went       club
  cut off   six feet    ;   then gave   piece     men
  told them   fine   evenly off     end,     proceeded
   ,   lastly   brought       point myself, charring   end
    fire   make   harder. When   had done     hid   under
dung,   was lying     over   cave,   told   men  
cast lots     them should venture along   myself   lift  
  bore   into   monster   eye while   was asleep.   lot fell
upon   very four whom   should   chosen,     myself made five.
    evening   wretch came back   shepherding,   drove  
flocks into   cave-   time driving them   inside,     leaving
any     yards;   suppose some fancy must   taken him,     god
must   prompted him      .   soon     had put   stone back
  its place against   door,   sat down, milked   ewes    
goats   quite rightly,   then let each     own young  ;
when   had got through       work,   gripped   two more
    men,   made   supper off them.     went     him  
  ivy wood bowl   black wine     hands: 

"'Look here, Cyclops,' said  ,     been eating   great deal  
man   flesh,   take     drink some wine,     may see  
kind   liquor   had   board   ship.   was bringing        
  drink offering,     hope       take compassion upon
    further       way home, whereas       is       ramping
  raving most intolerably.   ought     ashamed yourself; how
can   expect people   come see   any more     treat them  
  way?' 

"  then took   cup   drank.   was   delighted     taste
    wine     begged     another bowl full. '    kind,'
  said, '    give   some more,   tell   your name   once.
  want   make     present         glad    .    
wine even     country,   our soil grows grapes     sun ripens
them, but   drinks like nectar   ambrosia      .'

"  then gave him some more; three times did   fill   bowl   him,
  three times did   drain   without thought   heed; then, when
  saw     wine had got into   head,   said   him   plausibly
    could: 'Cyclops,   ask   name       tell    ; give
 , therefore,   present   promised  ;   name is Noman;  
is     father   mother     friends   always called  .'

"But   cruel wretch said, 'Then     eat   Noman   comrades
before Noman himself,     keep Noman     last.   is  
present       make him.' 

    spoke   reeled,   fell sprawling face upwards     ground.
  great neck hung heavily backwards     deep sleep took hold upon
him. Presently   turned sick,   threw   both wine     gobbets
  human flesh       had been gorging,     was very drunk.
Then   thrust   beam   wood far into   embers   heat  ,  
encouraged   men lest any   them should turn faint hearted. When
  wood, green though   was, was     blaze,   drew      
  fire glowing   heat,     men gathered round  ,   heaven
had filled   hearts   courage.   drove   sharp end    
beam into   monster   eye,   bearing upon         weight
  kept turning   round   round   though   were boring   hole  
  ship   plank     auger,   two men     wheel   strap

  red hot beam into   eye, till   boiling blood bubbled  
over       worked   round   round,       steam    
burning eyeball scalded   eyelids   eyebrows,     roots  
  eye sputtered     fire.     blacksmith plunges   axe   hatchet
into cold water   temper  -     is     gives strength  
  iron-     makes   great hiss     does  , even thus did  
Cyclops' eye hiss round   beam   olive wood,     hideous yells
made   cave ring again.   ran away     fright, but   plucked
  beam   besmirched   gore     eye,   hurled    
him     frenzy   rage   pain, shouting     did       other
Cyclopes   lived     bleak headlands near him;     gathered
    quarters round   cave when   heard him crying,   asked
  was   matter   him. 

"'  ails  , Polyphemus,' said  , '    make such   noise,
breaking   stillness     night,   preventing us   being
able   sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no
man is trying   kill   either   fraud     force? 

"But Polyphemus shouted   them   inside   cave, 'Noman is killing
    fraud! Noman is killing     force!' 

"'Then,' said  , '  no man is attacking  ,   must   ill;
when Jove makes people ill,   is no help    ,     had better
pray   your father Neptune.' 

"Then   went away,     laughed inwardly     success    
clever stratagem, but   Cyclops, groaning       agony   pain,
felt       hands till   found   stone   took    
  door; then   sat     doorway   stretched   hands   front
      catch anyone going       sheep,     thought   might
  foolish enough   attempt  . 

"    myself   kept   puzzling   think how   could best save  
own life   those     companions;   schemed   schemed,    
  knows     life depends upon  ,     danger was very great.
    end   deemed     plan       best.   male sheep
were well grown,   carried   heavy black fleece,     bound them
noiselessly   threes together,   some     withies    
  wicked monster used   sleep.   was       man under  
middle sheep,     two   either side were   cover him,    
  were three sheep   each man.     myself   was   ram
finer than any     others,     caught hold   him     back,
esconced myself     thick wool under   belly,   flung   patiently
    fleece, face upwards, keeping   firm hold         time.

"Thus, then, did   wait   great fear   mind till morning came,
but when   child   morning, rosy fingered Dawn, appeared,   male
sheep hurried     feed, while   ewes remained bleating  
  pens waiting     milked,     udders were full   bursting;
but   master   spite       pain felt   backs      
sheep     stood upright, without being sharp enough   find  
    men were underneath   bellies.     ram was going  ,
last    , heavy   its fleece       weight     crafty
self; Polyphemus laid hold       said: 

"'  good ram,   is     makes     last   leave   cave
  morning?   are   wont   let   ewes   before  , but
lead   mob     run whether   flowery mead   bubbling fountain,
  are   first   come home again   night; but now   lag last
   . Is   because   know your master has lost   eye,   are
sorry because   wicked Noman     horrid crew   got him down
    drink   blinded him? But         life yet.    
could understand   talk,     tell   where   wretch is hiding,
      dash   brains upon   ground till   flew   over
  cave.   should thus   some satisfaction     harm    
no good Noman has done  .' 

"  spoke   drove   ram outside, but when   were   little way
      cave   yards,   first got   under   ram   belly,
  then freed   comrades;       sheep,   were very fat,
  constantly heading them     right direction   managed   drive
them down     ship.   crew rejoiced greatly   seeing those  
us   had escaped death, but wept     others whom   Cyclops
had killed. However,   made signs   them   nodding   frowning
    were   hush   crying,   told them        
sheep   board   once   put     sea;     went aboard, took
  places,   smote   grey sea     oars. Then, when  
had got   far       voice   reach,   began   jeer    
Cyclops. 

"'Cyclops,' said  , '  should   taken better measure   your
man before eating     comrades   your cave.   wretch, eat  
your visitors   your own house?   might   known   your sin
  find    ,   now Jove     other gods   punished
 .' 

"  got more   more furious     heard  ,     tore   top  
off   high mountain,   flung   just   front     ship    
  was within   little   hitting   end     rudder.   sea quaked
    rock fell into  ,     wash     wave   raised carried
us back towards   mainland,   forced us towards   shore. But
  snatched     long pole   kept   ship off, making signs    
men   nodding   head,     must row     lives, whereon
  laid        . When   had got twice   far     were
before,   was   jeering     Cyclops again, but   men begged
  prayed       hold   tongue. 

"'   ,'   exclaimed, '  mad enough   provoke   savage creature
further;   has thrown   rock   us already   drove us back
again     mainland,     made sure   had been   death   us;
    had then heard any further sound   voices       pounded
our heads   our ship   timbers into   jelly     rugged rocks
      heaved   us,     can throw them   long way.'

"But       listen   them,   shouted     him     rage,
'Cyclops,   any   asks       was   put your eye    
spoiled your beauty,     was   valiant warrior Ulysses, son  
Laertes,   lives   Ithaca.' 

"      groaned,   cried  , 'Alas, alas, then   old prophecy
    is coming true.   was   prophet here,     time,  
man both brave     great stature, Telemus son   Eurymus,   was
  excellent seer,   did     prophesying     Cyclopes till
  grew old;   told           happen     some day,
  said   should lose   sight     hand   Ulysses.     been
  along expecting some     imposing presence   superhuman strength,
whereas   turns         little insignificant weakling,   has
managed   blind   eye   taking advantage         drink; come
here, then, Ulysses,     may make   presents   show   hospitality,
  urge Neptune   help   forward   your journey-   Neptune
    are father   son.  ,        , shall heal  ,  
no   else neither god nor man can  .' 

"Then   said, '  wish   could     sure   killing   outright  
sending   down     house   Hades,     am       take
more than Neptune   cure   eye   yours.' 

"      lifted     hands     firmament   heaven   prayed,
saying, 'Hear  , great Neptune;     am indeed your own true begotten
son, grant   Ulysses may never reach   home alive;       must
  back     friends   last, let him     late     sore plight
after losing     men [let him reach   home   another man  
ship   find trouble     house.'] 

"Thus did   pray,   Neptune heard   prayer. Then   picked  
  rock much larger than   first, swung   aloft   hurled    
prodigious force.   fell just short     ship, but was within  
little   hitting   end     rudder.   sea quaked     rock
fell into  ,     wash     wave   raised drove us onwards
  our way towards   shore     island. 

"When   last   got     island where   had left   rest   our
ships,   found our comrades lamenting us,   anxiously awaiting
our return.   ran our vessel upon   sands   got        
    sea shore;   also landed   Cyclops' sheep,   divided them
equitably amongst us     none might   reason   complain.  
    ram,   companions agreed     should         extra
share;     sacrificed       sea shore,   burned its thigh bones
  Jove,   is   lord    . But   heeded     sacrifice,  
only thought how   might destroy   ships     comrades.

"Thus through   livelong day     going down     sun   feasted
our fill   meat   drink, but when   sun went down     came
  dark,   camped upon   beach. When   child   morning, rosy fingered
Dawn, appeared,   bade   men   board   loose   hawsers. Then
  took   places   smote   grey sea     oars;  
  sailed     sorrow   our hearts, but glad     escaped death
though   had lost our comrades.

BOOK  

Thence   went       Aeoli island where lives Aeolus son   Hippotas,
dear     immortal gods.   is   island   floats (    were)
upon   sea, iron bound     wall   girds  . Now, Aeolus has
six daughters   six lusty sons,     made   sons marry   daughters,
      live     dear father   mother, feasting  
enjoying every conceivable kind   luxury.   day long   atmosphere
    house is loaded     savour   roasting meats till   groans
again, yard    ; but   night   sleep     well made bedsteads,
each     own wife between   blankets. These were   people
among whom   had now come. 

"Aeolus entertained       whole month asking   questions    
time   Troy,   Argive fleet,     return     Achaeans.
  told him exactly how everything had happened,   when   said  
must  ,   asked him   further       way,   made no sort  
difficulty, but set   doing     once. Moreover,   flayed  
  prime ox hide   hold   ways     roaring winds,     shut
      hide       sack-   Jove had made him captain over  
winds,     could stir   still each     them according    
own pleasure.   put   sack     ship   bound   mouth   tightly
    silver thread     even   breath     side wind could blow
  any quarter.   West wind   was fair   us did   alone
let blow     chose; but     came   nothing,     were lost
through our own folly. 

"Nine days   nine nights did   sail,       tenth day our native
land showed     horizon.   got   close       could see  
stubble fires burning,    , being then dead beat, fell into   light
sleep,     had never let   rudder       own hands,    
might   home   faster.       men fell   talking among themselves,
  said   was bringing back gold   silver     sack   Aeolus
had given  . 'Bless   heart,'     turn     neighbour, saying,
'how   man gets honoured   makes friends   whatever city  
country   may  . See   fine prizes   is taking home   Troy,
while  ,     travelled just   far     has, come back  
hands   empty     set    -   now Aeolus has given him ever
  much more. Quick- let us see       is,   how much gold
  silver   is     sack   gave him.' 

"Thus   talked   evil counsels prevailed.   loosed   sack,
whereupon   wind flew howling forth   raised   storm   carried
us weeping     sea   away   our own country. Then   awoke,
  knew   whether   throw myself into   sea     live    
make   best    ; but   bore  , covered myself  ,   lay down
    ship, while   men lamented bitterly     fierce winds bore
our fleet back     Aeolian island. 

"When   reached     went ashore   take   water,   dined hard
    ships. Immediately after dinner   took   herald      
  men   went straight     house   Aeolus, where   found him
feasting     wife   family;     sat down   suppliants  
  threshold.   were astounded when   saw us   said, 'Ulysses,
  brings   here?   god has been ill treating  ?   took
great pains   further     your way home   Ithaca,   wherever
  was     wanted      .' 

"Thus did   speak, but   answered sorrowfully, '  men   undone
 ;  ,   cruel sleep,   ruined  .   friends, mend    
mischief,     can      .' 

"  spoke   movingly     could, but   said nothing, till  
father answered, 'Vilest   mankind,     gone   once      
island; him whom heaven hates       no wise help.   off,  
  come here     abhorred   heaven. "    these words  
sent   sorrowing     door. 

"Thence   sailed sadly   till   men were worn     long  
fruitless rowing,     was no longer any wind   help them. Six
days, night   day did   toil,       seventh day   reached
  rocky stronghold   Lamus- Telepylus,   city     Laestrygonians,
where   shepherd   is driving     sheep   goats [    milked]
salutes him   is driving     flock [  feed]     last answers
  salute.     country   man   could   without sleep might
earn double wages,       herdsman   cattle,   another     shepherd,
    work much   same   night         day. 

"When   reached   harbour   found   land locked under steep cliffs,
    narrow entrance between two headlands.   captains took  
  ships inside,   made them fast close     another,    
was never   much     breath   wind inside, but   was always dead
calm.   kept   own ship outside,   moored       rock     very
end     point; then   climbed   high rock   reconnoitre, but could
see no sign neither   man nor cattle, only some smoke rising  
  ground.     sent two     company     attendant   find
    sort   people   inhabitants were. 

"  men when   got   shore followed   level road      
people draw   firewood     mountains into   town, till
presently   met   young woman   had come outside   fetch water,
    was daughter     Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was
going     fountain Artacia       people bring    
water,   when   men had come close      ,   asked    
  king     country might  ,   over   kind   people  
ruled;   she directed them     father   house, but when   got
    found   wife       giantess   huge     mountain,
    were horrified     sight    . 

"She   once called   husband Antiphates     place   assembly,
  forthwith   set   killing   men.   snatched       them,
  began   make   dinner off him then    , whereon   other
two ran back     ships   fast   ever   could. But Antiphates
raised   hue   cry after them,   thousands   sturdy Laestrygonians
sprang     every quarter- ogres,   men.   threw vast rocks
  us     cliffs   though   had been mere stones,     heard
  horrid sound     ships crunching   against   another,  
  death cries     men,     Laestrygonians speared them like
fishes   took them home   eat them. While   were thus killing
  men within   harbour   drew   sword, cut   cable     own
ship,   told   men   row   alf   might     too  
  fare like   rest;     laid       lives,     were
thankful enough when   got into open water     reach     rocks
  hurled   us.       others   was       them left.

"Thence   sailed sadly  , glad     escaped death, though  
had lost our comrades,   came     Aeaean island, where Circe
lives   great   cunning goddess   is own sister     magician
Aeetes-     are both children     sun   Perse,   is daughter
  Oceanus.   brought our ship into   safe harbour without   word,
  some god guided us thither,   having landed       two
days   two nights, worn     body   mind. When   morning  
  third day came   took   spear     sword,   went away  
  ship   reconnoitre,   see     could discover signs   human
handiwork,   hear   sound   voices. Climbing     top     high
look     espied   smoke   Circe   house rising upwards amid  
dense forest   trees,   when   saw     doubted whether, having
seen   smoke,             once   find   more, but  
  end   deemed   best     back     ship, give   men  
dinners,   send some   them instead   going myself. 

"When   had nearly got back     ship some god took pity upon  
solitude,   sent   fine antlered stag right into   middle    
path.   was coming down   pasture     forest   drink    
river,     heat     sun drove him,       passed   struck
him     middle     back;   bronze point     spear went
clean through him,     lay groaning     dust until   life
went     him. Then   set   foot upon him, drew   spear    
wound,   laid   down;   also gathered rough grass   rushes  
twisted them into   fathom       good stout rope,      
bound   four feet     noble creature together; having   done
  hung him round   neck   walked back     ship leaning upon
  spear,     stag was much too big         able   carry
him     shoulder, steadying him     hand.     threw him down
  front     ship,   called   men   spoke cheeringly man  
man   each   them. 'Look here   friends,' said  , '  are   going
  die   much before our time after  ,     any rate    
  starve   long       got something   eat   drink   board.'
      uncovered   heads upon   sea shore   admired
  stag,     was indeed   splendid fellow. Then, when   had
feasted   eyes upon him sufficiently,   washed   hands
  began   cook him   dinner. 

"Thus through   livelong day     going down     sun   stayed
  eating   drinking our fill, but when   sun went down  
  came   dark,   camped upon   sea shore. When   child   morning,
fingered Dawn, appeared,   called   council   said, '  friends,
  are   very great difficulties; listen therefore    .    
no idea where   sun either sets   rises,           even
know East   West.   see no way      ; nevertheless,   must
try   find  .   are certainly     island,     went   high
    could   morning,   saw   sea reaching   round    
  horizon;   lies low, but towards   middle   saw smoke rising
        thick forest   trees.' 

"  hearts sank     heard  ,     remembered how  
had been treated     Laestrygonian Antiphates,       savage
ogre Polyphemus.   wept bitterly     dismay, but   was
nothing     got   crying,     divided them into two companies
  set   captain over each;   gave   company   Eurylochus, while
  took command     other myself. Then   cast lots     helmet,
    lot fell upon Eurylochus;     set       twenty two
men,     wept,   also did     were left behind.

"When   reached Circe   house   found   built   cut stones,
    site   could   seen   far,     middle     forest.
  were wild mountain wolves   lions prowling   round  - poor
bewitched creatures whom she had tamed     enchantments   drugged
into subjection.   did   attack   men, but wagged   great
tails, fawned upon them,   rubbed   noses lovingly against them.
  hounds crowd round   master when   see him coming   dinner-
    know     bring them something- even   did these wolves
  lions     great claws fawn upon   men, but   men were
terribly frightened   seeing such strange creatures. Presently  
reached   gates     goddess   house,       stood  
  could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully   she worked
    loom, making   web   fine,   soft,     such dazzling colours
  no   but   goddess could weave.     Polites, whom   valued
  trusted more than any other     men, said, '  is some  
inside working     loom   singing most beautifully;   whole place
resounds    , let us call     see whether she is woman  
goddess.' 

"  called     she came down, unfastened   door,   bade
them enter.  , thinking no evil, followed  ,   except Eurylochus,
  suspected mischief   stayed outside. When she had got them into
  house, she set them upon benches   seats   mixed them   mess
  cheese, honey, meal,   Pramnian but she drugged     wicked
poisons   make them forget   homes,   when   had drunk she
turned them into pigs     stroke     wand,   shut them    
  pigsties.   were like pigs head, hair,    ,     grunted
just   pigs  ; but   senses were   same   before,    
remembered everything. 

"Thus then were   shut   squealing,   Circe threw them some
acorns   beech masts such   pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back
  tell       sad fate   our comrades.   was   overcome
  dismay   though   tried   speak   could find no words  
   ;   eyes filled   tears     could only sob   sigh,
till   last   forced   story     him,     told us   had
happened     others. 

"'  went,' said  ,     told us, through   forest,      
middle       was   fine house built   cut stones     place
  could   seen   far.     found   woman,   else she was
  goddess, working     loom   singing sweetly;     men shouted
      called  , whereon she   once came down, opened   door,
  invited us  .   others did   suspect any mischief    
followed   into   house, but   stayed where   was,     thought
  might   some treachery.     moment   saw them no more,
        them ever came  , though   sat   long time watching
  them.' 

"Then   took   sword   bronze   slung   over   shoulders;  
also took   bow,   told Eurylochus   come back       show
    way. But   laid hold       both   hands   spoke piteously,
saying, 'Sir,     force          , but let   stay here,
    know       bring     them back    , nor even
return alive yourself; let us rather see     cannot escape   any
rate     few   are left us,     may still save our lives.'

"'Stay where   are, then, 'answered  , 'eating   drinking    
ship, but   must  ,     am most urgently bound      .'

"      left   ship   went   inland. When   got through
  charmed grove,   was near   great house     enchantress
Circe,   met Mercury     golden wand, disguised     young man
    hey day     youth   beauty     down just coming upon
  face.   came         took   hand within   own, saying,
'  poor unhappy man, whither are   going over   mountain top,
alone   without knowing   way? Your men are shut     Circe  
pigsties, like   many wild boars     lairs.   surely    
fancy     can set them free?   can tell         never
  back         stay       rest   them. But never
mind,     protect             your difficulty. Take
  herb,   is     great virtue,   keep       when
      Circe   house,         talisman     against every
kind   mischief. 

"'      tell         wicked witchcraft   Circe  
try   practise upon  . She   mix   mess       drink,  
she   drug   meal     she makes  , but she      
able   charm  ,     virtue     herb     shall give  
  prevent   spells   working.     tell        .
When Circe strikes       wand, draw your sword   spring upon

  take good care also   yourself, but   make   swear solemnly
      blessed   she   plot no further mischief against

  fit   nothing.' 

"    spoke   pulled   herb       ground   showed    
  was like.   root was black, while   flower was   white  
milk;   gods call   Moly,   mortal men cannot uproot  , but
  gods can   whatever   like. 

"Then Mercury went back   high Olympus passing over   wooded island;
but   fared onward     house   Circe,     heart was clouded
  care     walked along. When   got     gates   stood  
  called   goddess,     soon   she heard   she came down,
opened   door,   asked     come  ;     followed  - much
troubled     mind. She set       richly decorated seat inlaid
  silver,   was   footstool also under   feet,   she mixed
  mess     golden goblet       drink; but she drugged  ,  
she meant   mischief. When she had given    ,     had drunk  
without its charming  , she struck she, struck       wand.
'  now,' she cried, '  off     pigsty,   make your lair
    rest   them.' 

"But   rushed         sword drawn   though     kill  ,
whereon she fell     loud scream, clasped   knees,   spoke piteously,
saying, '    whence are  ?     place   people    
come? How can         drugs   no power   charm  ? Never
yet was any man able   stand   much     taste     herb   gave
 ;   must   spell proof; surely   can   none other than  
bold hero Ulysses,   Mercury always said   come here some day
    ship while     way home form Troy;       then; sheathe
your sword   let us     bed,     may make friends   learn
  trust each other.' 

"    answered, 'Circe, how can   expect       friendly  
  when     just been turning     men into pigs?   now
      got   here myself,   mean   mischief when   ask
        bed    ,     unman     make   fit   nothing.
  shall certainly   consent       bed     unless    
first take your solemn oath   plot no further harm against  .'

"  she swore   once     had told  ,   when she had completed
  oath then   went   bed    . 

"Meanwhile   four servants,   are   housemaids, set    
work.   are   children     groves   fountains,      
holy waters   run down into   sea.     them spread   fair
purple cloth over   seat,   laid   carpet underneath  . Another
brought tables   silver       seats,   set them   baskets
  gold.   third mixed some sweet wine   water     silver bowl
  put golden cups upon   tables, while   fourth she brought
  water   set     boil     large cauldron over   good fire  
she had lighted. When   water     cauldron was boiling, she poured
cold into   till   was just     liked  ,   then she set    
  bath   began washing       cauldron     head   shoulders,
  take   tire   stiffness       limbs.   soon   she had
done washing     anointing     oil, she arrayed       good
cloak   shirt   led       richly decorated seat inlaid  
silver;   was   footstool also under   feet.   maid servant then
brought   water     beautiful golden ewer   poured   into   silver
basin       wash   hands,   she drew   clean table beside  ;
  upper servant brought   bread   offered   many things    
  was     house,   then Circe bade   eat, but      ,
  sat without heeding   was before  , still moody   suspicious.

"When Circe saw   sitting   without eating,     great grief,
she came       said, 'Ulysses, why     sit like     though
  were dumb, gnawing   your own heart,   refusing both meat  
drink? Is       are still suspicious?   ought      ,  
    already sworn solemnly         hurt  .'

"    said, 'Circe, no man   any sense     is right can think
  either eating   drinking   your house until     set  
friends free   let him see them.     want     eat   drink,
  must free   men   bring them         may see them  
  own eyes.' 

"When   had said   she went straight through   court    
wand     hand   opened   pigsty doors.   men came   like
  many prime hogs   stood looking    , but she went   among
them   anointed each     second drug, whereon   bristles  
  bad drug had given them fell off,     became men again, younger
than   were before,   much taller   better looking.   knew
    once, seized   each   them     hand,   wept   joy till
  whole house was filled     sound     hullabalooing,
  Circe herself was   sorry   them   she came        
said, 'Ulysses, noble son   Laertes,   back   once     sea where
    left your ship,   first draw         land. Then, hide
  your ship   gear   property   some cave,   come back here
  your men.' 

"  agreed    ,     went back     sea shore,   found  
men     ship weeping   wailing most piteously. When   saw
    silly blubbering fellows began frisking round     calves
break     gambol round   mothers, when   see them coming
home     milked after     been feeding   day,     homestead
resounds     lowing.   seemed   glad   see     though
  had got back     own rugged Ithaca, where   had been
born   bred. 'Sir,' said   affectionate creatures, '  are  
glad   see   back   though   had got safe home   Ithaca; but
tell us       fate   our comrades.' 

"  spoke comfortingly   them   said, '  must draw our ship  
    land,   hide   ship   gear     our property   some
cave; then come             fast     can   Circe   house,
where     find your comrades eating   drinking     midst
  great abundance.' 

"      men     come       once, but Eurylochus tried
  hold them back   said, 'Alas, poor wretches     are,  
  become   us? Rush     your ruin   going     house  
Circe,     turn us   into pigs   wolves   lions,     shall
    keep guard over   house. Remember how   Cyclops treated
us when our comrades went inside   cave,   Ulysses   them.
  was   through   sheer folly   those men lost   lives.'

"When   heard him   was   two minds whether   no   draw   keen
blade   hung     sturdy thigh   cut   head off   spite  
  being   near relation     own; but   men interceded   him
  said, 'Sir,     may    , let   fellow stay here   mind
  ship, but take   rest   us       Circe   house.'

"        went inland,   Eurylochus was   left behind after
 , but came   too,     was frightened     severe reprimand
    had given him. 

"Meanwhile Circe had been seeing     men   had been left behind
were washed   anointed   olive oil; she had also given them woollen
cloaks   shirts,   when   came   found them   comfortably
  dinner     house.   soon     men saw each other face  
face   knew   another,   wept   joy   cried aloud till
  whole palace rang again. Thereon Circe came         said,
'Ulysses, noble son   Laertes, tell your men   leave off crying;
  know how much           suffered   sea,   how ill  
  fared among cruel savages     mainland, but   is over now,
  stay here,   eat   drink till   are once more   strong  
hearty     were when   left Ithaca;     present   are weakened
both   body   mind;   keep     time thinking     hardships-
    suffered during your travels,         no more cheerfulness
left    .' 

"Thus did she speak     assented.   stayed   Circe     whole
twelvemonth feasting upon   untold quantity both   meat   wine.
But when   year had passed     waning   moons     long days
had come round,   men called   apart   said, 'Sir,   is time
  began   think   going home,         are     spared
  see your house   native country    .' 

"Thus did   speak     assented. Thereon through   livelong
day     going down     sun   feasted our fill   meat   wine,
but when   sun went down     came   dark   men laid themselves
down   sleep     covered cloisters.  , however, after   had got
into bed   Circe, besought       knees,     goddess listened
      had got    . 'Circe,' said  , 'please   keep   promise
  made     furthering       homeward voyage.   want    
back         men,   are always pestering       complaints
  soon   ever your back is turned.' 

"    goddess answered, 'Ulysses, noble son   Laertes,   shall
none     stay here any longer         want  , but  
is another journey       got   take before   can sail
homewards.   must       house   Hades     dread Proserpine
  consult   ghost     blind Theban prophet Teiresias whose reason
is still unshaken.   him alone has Proserpine left   understanding
even   death, but   other ghosts flit   aimlessly.'

"  was dismayed when   heard  .   sat     bed   wept,    
gladly   lived no longer   see   light     sun, but presently
when   was tired   weeping   tossing myself  ,   said, ' 
  shall guide   upon   voyage-     house   Hades is   port
  no ship can reach.' 

"'    want no guide,' she answered; 'raise   mast, set your
white sails, sit quite still,     North Wind   blow    
  itself. When your ship has traversed   waters   Oceanus,  
  reach   fertile shore   Proserpine   country   its groves
  tall poplars   willows   shed   fruit untimely; here beach
your ship upon   shore   Oceanus,     straight       dark
abode   Hades.     find   near   place where   rivers Pyriphlegethon
  Cocytus (  is   branch     river Styx) flow into Acheron,
      see   rock near  , just where   two roaring rivers
run into   another. 

"'When     reached   spot,     now tell  , dig   trench
  cubit       length, breadth,   depth,   pour into      
drink offering       dead, first, honey mixed   milk, then
wine,       third place water sprinkling white barley meal over
  whole. Moreover   must offer many prayers     poor feeble
ghosts,   promise them   when     back   Ithaca

  pyre   good things. More particularly   must promise  
Teiresias shall     black sheep     himself,   finest    
your flocks. 

"'When   shall   thus besought   ghosts   your prayers,
offer them   ram     black ewe, bending   heads towards Erebus;
but yourself turn away   them   though     make towards

must tell your men   skin   two sheep       just killed,
  offer them     burnt sacrifice   prayers   Hades     Proserpine.
Then draw your sword   sit  ,       prevent any other poor
ghost   coming near   split blood before Teiresias shall  
answered your questions.   seer   presently come    ,  
  tell     your voyage-   stages   are   make,  
how   are   sail   see       reach your home.' 

"  was day break     time she had done speaking,   she dressed
      shirt   cloak.     herself she threw   beautiful light
gossamer fabric over   shoulders, fastening       golden girdle
round   waist,   she covered   head     mantle. Then   went
  among   men everywhere   over   house,   spoke kindly
  each   them man   man: '  must   lie sleeping here any longer,'
said     them, '  must   going,   Circe has told      
 .'       did     bade them. 

"Even  , however,   did     them away without misadventure.  
had   us   certain youth named Elpenor,   very remarkable  
sense   courage,   had got drunk   was lying     house top
away     rest     men,   sleep off   liquor     cool.
When   heard   noise     men bustling  ,   jumped    
  sudden   forgot     coming down     main staircase,  
  tumbled right off   roof   broke   neck,     soul went
down     house   Hades. 

"When   had got   men together   said   them, '  think   are

"  men were broken hearted     heard  ,   threw themselves
    ground groaning   tearing   hair, but   did   mend
matters   crying. When   reached   sea shore, weeping   lamenting
our fate, Circe brought   ram     ewe,     made them fast
hard     ship. She passed through   midst   us without our knowing

BOOK XI

Then, when   had got down     sea shore   drew our ship into
  water   got   mast   sails into  ;   also put   sheep
  board   took our places, weeping     great distress   mind.
Circe,   great   cunning goddess, sent us   fair wind   blew
dead aft   stayed steadily   us keeping our sails     time
well filled;     did whatever wanted doing     ship   gear  
let         wind   helmsman headed  .   day long   sails
were full   she held   course over   sea, but when   sun went
down   darkness was over     earth,   got into   deep waters
    river Oceanus, where lie   land   city     Cimmerians
  live enshrouded   mist   darkness     rays     sun
never pierce neither     rising nor     goes down again    
  heavens, but   poor wretches live     long melancholy night.
When   got     beached   ship, took   sheep      ,
  went along     waters   Oceanus till   came     place
    Circe had told us. 

"Here Perimedes   Eurylochus held   victims, while   drew   sword
  dug   trench   cubit each way.   made   drink offering    
  dead, first   honey   milk, then   wine,   thirdly  
water,     sprinkled white barley meal over   whole, praying earnestly
    poor feckless ghosts,   promising them   when   got back
  Ithaca     sacrifice   barren heifer   them,   best   had,
    load   pyre   good things.   also particularly promised
  Teiresias should     black sheep   himself,   best    
  flocks. When   had prayed sufficiently     dead,   cut   throats
    two sheep   let   blood run into   trench, whereon  
ghosts came trooping     Erebus- brides, young bachelors, old
men worn     toil, maids   had been crossed   love,   brave
men   had been killed   battle,     armour still smirched
  blood;   came   every quarter   flitted round   trench
    strange kind   screaming sound   made   turn pale  
fear. When   saw them coming   told   men     quick   flay  
carcasses     two dead sheep   make burnt offerings   them,
      same time   repeat prayers   Hades     Proserpine;
but   sat where   was     sword drawn       let   poor
feckless ghosts come near   blood till Teiresias should   answered
  questions. 

"  first ghost '  came was       comrade Elpenor,    
had   yet been laid beneath   earth.   had left   body unwaked
  unburied   Circe   house,     had had too much else    .
  was very sorry   him,   cried when   saw him: 'Elpenor,' said
 , 'how did   come down here into   gloom   darkness?    
here   foot quicker than         ship.' 

"'Sir,'   answered     groan, '  was   bad luck,     own
unspeakable drunkenness.   was lying asleep     top   Circe  
house,   never thought   coming down again     great staircase
but fell right off   roof   broke   neck,     soul down  
  house   Hades.   now   beseech       those whom    
left behind  , though   are   here,   your wife,     father
  brought     when   were   child,     Telemachus   is

when   leave   limbo     again hold your ship     Aeaean
island.       thence leaving   unwaked   unburied behind  ,
    may bring heaven   anger upon  ; but burn     whatever
armour    , build   barrow         sea shore,   may tell
people   days   come     poor unlucky fellow   was,   plant
over   grave   oar   used   row   when   was yet alive  
    messmates.'     said, '  poor fellow,          
    asked    .' 

"Thus, then, did   sit   hold sad talk     another,      
  side     trench     sword held over   blood,    
ghost     comrade saying             other side. Then
came   ghost     dead mother Anticlea, daughter   Autolycus.
  had left   alive when   set     Troy   was moved   tears
when   saw  , but even  ,       sorrow       let  
come near   blood till   had asked   questions   Teiresias.

"Then came also   ghost   Theban Teiresias,     golden sceptre
    hand.   knew     said, 'Ulysses, noble son   Laertes,
why, poor man,     left   light   day   come down   visit
  dead     sad place? Stand back     trench   withdraw
your sword     may drink     blood   answer your questions
truly.' 

"    drew back,   sheathed   sword, whereon when   had drank
    blood   began     prophecy. 

"  want   know,' said  , '  your return home, but heaven  
make   hard    .       think       escape   eye

Even though   may yourself escape,     return   bad plight

"'When     home     take your revenge   these suitors;

"' ,'   answered, 'must       may please heaven, but tell  
  tell     tell   true,   see   poor mother   ghost close  
us; she is sitting     blood without saying   word,   though
  am   own son she does   remember     speak    ; tell  ,
Sir, how   can make   know  .' 

"' ,' said  , '  can soon   Any ghost     let taste    
blood   talk     like   reasonable being, but        
let them   any blood       away again.' 

"      ghost   Teiresias went back     house   Hades,  
  prophecyings had now been spoken, but   sat still where   was
until   mother came     tasted   blood. Then she knew    
once   spoke fondly    , saying, '  son, how did   come down
    abode   darkness while   are still alive?   is   hard
thing     living   see these places,   between us   them
  are great   terrible waters,     is Oceanus,   no
man can cross   foot, but   must     good ship   take him. Are
      time trying   find your way home   Troy,    
  never yet got back   Ithaca nor seen your wife   your own house?'

"'Mother,' said  , '  was forced   come here   consult   ghost
    Theban prophet Teiresias.     never yet been near   Achaean
land nor set foot     native country,       had nothing but
  long series   misfortunes     very first day     set
    Agamemnon   Ilius,   land   noble steeds,   fight  
Trojans. But tell  ,   tell   true,     way did   die? Did
      long illness,   did heaven vouchsafe     gentle easy
passage   eternity? Tell   also     father,     son whom
  left behind  ; is   property still     hands,   has some
  else got hold    ,   thinks     shall   return   claim
 ? Tell   again     wife intends doing,       mind she
is; does she live     son   guard   estate securely,   has
she made   best match she could   married again?' 

"  mother answered, 'Your wife still remains   your house, but she
is   great distress   mind   spends   whole time   tears both
night   day. No     yet has got possession   your fine property,
  Telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed.   has   entertain

  how every   invites him; your father remains     old place
    country   never goes near   town.   has no comfortable
bed nor bedding;     winter   sleeps     floor   front

  warm weather comes   again,   lies       vineyard    
bed   vine leaves thrown anyhow upon   ground.   grieves continually
  your never having come home,   suffers more   more    
grows older.       own end   was     wise: heaven did  
take   swiftly   painlessly     own house, nor was   attacked
  any illness such   those   generally wear people     kill
them, but   longing   know     were doing     force  
  affection    -     was   was   death    .'

"Then   tried   find some way   embracing   mother   ghost. Thrice
  sprang towards     tried   clasp       arms, but each time
she flitted     embrace     were   dream   phantom,   being
touched     quick   said    , 'Mother, why       stay still
when     embrace  ?     could throw our arms around   another
  might find sad comfort     sharing   our sorrows even    
house   Hades; does Proserpine want   lay   still further load  
grief upon     mocking       phantom only?' 

"'  son,' she answered, 'most ill fated     mankind,   is  
Proserpine   is beguiling  , but   people are like   when
  are dead.   sinews no longer hold   flesh   bones together;
these perish     fierceness   consuming fire   soon   life has
left   body,     soul flits away   though   were   dream.
Now, however,   back     light   day   soon     can,  
note   these things     may tell them   your wife hereafter.'

"Thus did   converse,   anon Proserpine sent     ghosts    
wives   daughters       most famous men.   gathered   crowds
    blood,     considered how   might question them severally.
    end   deemed         best   draw   keen blade  
hung     sturdy thigh,   keep them     drinking   blood

  told     race   lineage. 

"  first   saw was Tyro. She was daughter   Salmoneus   wife
  Cretheus   son   Aeolus. She fell   love     river Enipeus
  is much   most beautiful river     whole world. Once when
she was taking   walk     side   usual, Neptune, disguised

When   god had accomplished   deed   love,   took   hand

"Then   dived under   sea,   she   due course bore Pelias  
Neleus,   both   them served Jove       might. Pelias
was   great breeder   sheep   lived   Iolcus, but   other lived
  Pylos.   rest     children were   Cretheus, namely, Aeson,
Pheres,   Amythaon,   was   mighty warrior   charioteer.

"Next       saw Antiope, daughter   Asopus,   could boast  
having slept     arms   even Jove himself,     bore him two
sons Amphion   Zethus. These founded Thebes   its seven gates,
  built   wall   round  ;   strong though   were   could
  hold Thebes till   had walled  . 

"Then   saw Alcmena,   wife   Amphitryon,   also bore   Jove
indomitable Hercules;   Megara   was daughter   great King Creon,
  married   redoubtable son   Amphitryon. 

"  also saw fair Epicaste mother   king OEdipodes whose awful lot
  was   marry   own son without suspecting  .   married  
after having killed   father, but   gods proclaimed   whole
story     world; whereon   remained king   Thebes,   great grief
    spite   gods had borne him; but Epicaste went     house
    mighty jailor Hades, having hanged herself   grief,    
avenging spirits haunted him       outraged mother-     ruing
bitterly thereafter. 

"Then   saw Chloris, whom Neleus married     beauty, having given
priceless presents    . She was youngest daughter   Amphion son
  Iasus   king   Minyan Orchomenus,   was Queen   Pylos. She
bore Nestor, Chromius,   Periclymenus,   she also bore   marvellously
lovely woman Pero,   was wooed       country round; but Neleus
  only give     him   should raid   cattle   Iphicles
    grazing grounds   Phylace,     was   hard task.  
only man     undertake   raid them was   certain excellent
seer, but       heaven was against him,     rangers    
cattle caught him   put him   prison; nevertheless when   full
year had passed     same season came round again, Iphicles set
him   liberty, after   had expounded     oracles   heaven.
Thus, then, was       Jove accomplished. 

"    saw Leda   wife   Tyndarus,   bore him two famous sons,
Castor breaker   horses,   Pollux   mighty boxer. Both these
heroes are lying under   earth, though   are still alive,  
    special dispensation   Jove,   die   come   life again,
each     them every other day throughout   time,      
  rank   gods. 

"After     saw Iphimedeia wife   Aloeus   boasted   embrace
  Neptune. She bore two sons Otus   Ephialtes, but both were short
lived.   were   finest children   were ever born     world,
    best looking, Orion only excepted;     nine years old  
were nine fathoms high,   measured nine cubits round   chest.

both   them, before   had got   much     sign   hair upon  
cheeks   chin. 

"Then   saw Phaedra,   Procris,   fair Ariadne daughter    
magician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off   Crete   Athens,
but   did   enjoy  ,   before   could     Diana killed  
    island   Dia   account     Bacchus had said against  .

"  also saw Maera   Clymene   hateful Eriphyle,   sold   own
husband   gold. But     take     night     were   name
every single       wives   daughters   heroes whom   saw,
    is time           bed, either   board ship     crew,
  here.       escort, heaven   yourselves   see    ."

Here   ended,     guests sat     them enthralled   speechless
throughout   covered cloister. Then Arete said   them:

"      think     man,   Phaecians? Is     tall   good
looking,   is     Clever? True,   is   own guest, but    
  share     distinction.         hurry   send him away,
nor niggardly     presents   make       is   such great
need,   heaven has blessed         great abundance."

Then spoke   aged hero Echeneus   was       oldest men among
them, "  friends," said  , "  our august queen has just said
  us is both reasonable       purpose, therefore   persuaded
   ; but   decision whether   word   deed rests ultimately  
King Alcinous." 

"  thing shall   done," exclaimed Alcinous, "  surely     still
live   reign over   Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious
    home, still   must persuade him   remain   us until   morrow,
    time   shall   able     together   whole sum    
mean   give him.   regards-   escort         matter    
 ,   mine above   others     chief person among  ."

  Ulysses answered, "King Alcinous,     were   bid     stay
here     whole twelve months,   then speed       way, loaded
  your noble gifts,   should obey   gladly       redound
greatly     advantage,     should return fuller handed     own
people,   should thus   more respected   beloved       see
  when     back   Ithaca." 

"Ulysses," replied Alcinous, "      us   sees   has any idea
    are   charlatan     swindler.   know   are many people
going     tell such plausible stories     is very hard  
see through them, but   is   style   your language   assures
    your good disposition. Moreover     told   story   your
own misfortunes,   those     Argives,   though   were   practised
bard; but tell  ,   tell   true, whether   saw any     mighty
heroes   went   Troy     same time   yourself,   perished
 .   evenings are still     longest,     is   yet
bed time-    , therefore,   your divine story,     could stay
here listening till   morrow morning,   long       continue
  tell us   your adventures." 

"Alcinous," answered Ulysses, "  is   time   making speeches,
    time   going   bed; nevertheless, since     desire,  
    refrain   telling     still sadder tale   those  
  comrades   did   fall fighting     Trojans, but perished
    return, through   treachery     wicked woman.

"When Proserpine had dismissed   female ghosts     directions,
  ghost   Agamemnon son   Atreus came sadly   tome, surrounded
  those   had perished   him     house   Aegisthus.   soon
    had tasted   blood   knew  ,   weeping bitterly stretched
    arms towards     embrace  ; but   had no strength nor
substance any more,     too wept   pitied him     beheld him.
'How did   come   your death,' said  , 'King Agamemnon? Did Neptune
raise   winds   waves against   when   were   sea,   did
your enemies make   end         mainland when   were cattle lifting
  sheep stealing,   while   were fighting   defence    
wives   city?' 

"'Ulysses,'   answered, 'noble son   Laertes, was   lost   sea
  any storm   Neptune   raising, nor did   foes despatch   upon
  mainland, but Aegisthus     wicked wife were   death    
between them.   asked       house, feasted  ,   then butchered
  most miserably   though   were   fat beast     slaughter house,
while   around     comrades were slain like sheep   pigs  
  wedding breakfast,   picnic,   gorgeous banquet   some great
nobleman.   must   seen numbers   men killed either     general
engagement,     single combat, but   never saw anything   truly
pitiable     way       fell     cloister,     mixing bowl
    loaded tables lying    ,     ground reeking  
our blood.   heard Priam   daughter Cassandra scream   Clytemnestra
killed   close beside  .   lay dying upon   earth     sword
    body,   raised   hands   kill   slut     murderess, but
she slipped away    ; she     even close   lips nor  
eyes when   was dying,     is nothing     world   cruel
    shameless     woman when she has fallen into such guilt  
hers was. Fancy murdering   own husband!   thought   was going  
  welcomed home     children     servants, but   abominable
crime has brought disgrace   herself     women   shall come
after- even     good ones.' 

"    said, '  truth Jove has hated   house   Atreus   first
  last     matter     women   counsels. See how many   us
fell   Helen   sake,   now   seems   Clytemnestra hatched
mischief against too during your absence.' 

"'  sure, therefore,' continued Agamemnon, '      too friendly
even   your own wife.     tell         know perfectly
well yourself. Tell     part only,   keep your own counsel  
  rest.     your wife, Ulysses, is likely   murder  ,  
Penelope is   very admirable woman,   has   excellent nature.  
left     young bride     infant     breast when   set  
  Troy.   child no doubt is now grown   happily   man   estate,
        father       joyful meeting   embrace   another
    is right   should  , whereas   wicked wife did   even
allow     happiness   looking upon   son, but killed   ere  
could    . Furthermore    -   lay   saying   your heart-  
  tell people when   are bringing your ship   Ithaca, but steal
  march upon them,   after       is no trusting women.
But now tell  ,   tell   true, can   give   any news    
son Orestes? Is     Orchomenus,     Pylos,   is     Sparta
  Menelaus-     presume     is still living.' 

"    said, 'Agamemnon, why     ask  ?       know whether
your son is alive   dead,     is   right   talk when   does
  know.' 

"    two sat weeping   talking thus sadly     another  
ghost   Achilles came     us   Patroclus, Antilochus,   Ajax
  was   finest   goodliest man       Danaans after  
son   Peleus.   fleet descendant   Aeacus knew     spoke piteously,
saying, 'Ulysses, noble son   Laertes,   deed   daring    
undertake next,     venture down     house   Hades among
us silly dead,   are but   ghosts   them   can labour no more?'

"    said, 'Achilles, son   Peleus, foremost champion     Achaeans,
  came   consult Teiresias,   see     could advise      
return home   Ithaca,       never yet been able     near
  Achaean land, nor   set foot     own country, but   been
  trouble     time.      , Achilles, no   was ever yet
  fortunate       been, nor ever    ,     were adored
    us Argives   long     were alive,   now     are
here   are   great prince among   dead.    , therefore, take
    much   heart even     are dead.' 

"'      word,'   answered, '  death   favour;     rather
    paid servant     poor man   house     above ground than king
  kings among   dead. But give   news   son; is   gone  
  wars           great soldier,   is      ? Tell  
also       heard anything     father Peleus- does   still
rule among   Myrmidons,       show him no respect throughout
Hellas   Phthia now     is old     limbs fail him? Could
  but stand     side,     light   day,     same strength
    had when   killed   bravest   our foes upon   plain  
Troy- could   but       then was     even     short time  
  father   house, any     tried     him violence   supersede
him   soon    .' 

"'    heard nothing,'   answered, '  Peleus, but   can tell  
    your son Neoptolemus,     took him     own ship  
Scyros     Achaeans.   our councils   war before Troy   was
always first   speak,     judgement was unerring. Nestor  
  were   only two   could surpass him;   when   came   fighting
    plain   Troy,     never remain     body     men,
but   dash   far   front, foremost   them     valour. Many
  man did   kill   battle-   cannot name every single     those
whom   slew while fighting     side     Argives, but   only
  how   killed   valiant hero Eurypylus son   Telephus,  
was   handsomest man   ever saw except Memnon; many others also
    Ceteians fell around him   reason     woman   bribes. Moreover,
when     bravest     Argives went inside   horse   Epeus
had made,     was left       settle when   should either open
  door   our ambuscade,   close  , though     other leaders
  chief men among   Danaans were drying   eyes   quaking
  every limb,   never once saw him turn pale nor wipe   tear  
  cheek;   was     time urging     break       horse-
grasping   handle     sword     bronze shod spear,   breathing
fury against   foe. Yet when   had sacked   city   Priam  
got   handsome share     prize money   went   board (such
is   fortune   war) without   wound upon him, neither     thrown
spear nor   close combat,     rage   Mars is   matter   great
chance.' 

"When   had told him  ,   ghost   Achilles strode off across
  meadow full   asphodel, exulting over     had said concerning
  prowess     son. 

"  ghosts   other dead men stood near     told   each   own
melancholy tale; but     Ajax son   Telamon alone held aloof-
still angry       having won   cause   our dispute  
  armour   Achilles. Thetis had offered       prize, but  
Trojan prisoners   Minerva were   judges.       had never
gained   day   such   contest,     cost   life   Ajax,  
was foremost       Danaans after   son   Peleus, alike  
stature   prowess. 

"When   saw him   tried   pacify him   said, 'Ajax,      
forget   forgive even   death, but must   judgement    
hateful armour still rankle    ?   cost us Argives dear enough
  lose such   tower   strength     were   us.   mourned  
  much     mourned Achilles son   Peleus himself, nor can  
blame   laid   anything but     spite   Jove bore against
  Danaans,     was     made him counsel your destruction-
come hither, therefore, bring your proud spirit into subjection,  
hear     can tell  .' 

"      answer, but turned away   Erebus       other ghosts;
nevertheless,   should   made him talk       spite     being
  angry,     should   gone talking   him, only     were
still others among   dead whom   desired   see. 

"Then   saw Minos son   Jove     golden sceptre     hand
sitting   judgement     dead,     ghosts were gathered sitting
  standing round him     spacious house   Hades,   learn  
sentences upon them. 

"After him   saw huge Orion     meadow full   asphodel driving  
ghosts     wild beasts     had killed upon   mountains,  
  had   great bronze club     hand, unbreakable   ever   ever.

"    saw Tityus son   Gaia stretched upon   plain   covering
some nine acres   ground. Two vultures   either side   him were
digging   beaks into   liver,     kept   trying   beat
them off     hands, but could  ;     had violated Jove  
mistress Leto   she was going through Panopeus     way   Pytho.

"  saw also   dreadful fate   Tantalus,   stood     lake  
reached   chin;   was dying   quench   thirst, but could never
reach   water,   whenever   poor creature stooped   drink,
  dried     vanished,       was nothing but dry ground-
parched     spite   heaven.   were tall trees, moreover,  
shed   fruit over   head- pears, pomegranates, apples, sweet
figs   juicy olives, but whenever   poor creature stretched  
  hand   take some,   wind tossed   branches back again  
  clouds. 

"    saw Sisyphus     endless task raising   prodigious stone
  both   hands.   hands   feet  ' tried   roll      
  top     hill, but always, just before   could roll   over
      other side, its weight     too much   him,    
pitiless stone   come thundering down again       plain. Then
    begin trying   push     hill again,     sweat ran
off him     steam rose after him. 

"After him   saw mighty Hercules, but   was   phantom only,  
  is feasting ever     immortal gods,   has lovely Hebe  
wife,   is daughter   Jove   Juno.   ghosts were screaming
round him like scared birds flying   whithers.   looked black  
night     bare bow     hands     arrow     string,
glaring around   though ever     point   taking aim.    
breast   was   wondrous golden belt adorned     most marvellous

was also war, battle,   death.   man   made   belt,    
  might,   never   able   make another like  . Hercules knew
    once when   saw  ,   spoke piteously, saying,   poor Ulysses,
noble son   Laertes, are   too leading   same sorry kind   life
    did when   was above ground?   was son   Jove, but   went
through   infinity   suffering,     became bondsman

  could find anything harder     than  , but   got   hound

"    Hercules went down again into   house   Hades, but   stayed
where   was   case some other     mighty dead should come    .
    should   seen still other   them   are gone before, whom

BOOK XII

"After   were clear     river Oceanus,   had got   into  
open sea,   went   till   reached   Aeaean island where  
is dawn   sunrise     other places.   then drew our ship    
  sands   got             shore, where   went   sleep
  waited till day should break. 

"Then, when   child   morning, rosy fingered Dawn, appeared,  
sent some men   Circe   house   fetch   body   Elpenor.   cut
firewood     wood where   headland jutted   into   sea,  
after   had wept over him   lamented him   performed   funeral
rites. When   body   armour had been burned   ashes,   raised
  cairn, set   stone over  ,       top     cairn   fixed
  oar     had been used   row  . 

"While   were doing    , Circe,   knew     had got back
    house   Hades, dressed herself   came   us   fast  
she could;     maid servants came     bringing us bread,
meat,   wine. Then she stood     midst   us   said, '   
done   bold thing   going down alive     house   Hades,    
    died twice,   other people   once; now, then, stay here
    rest     day, feast your fill,         your voyage
  daybreak tomorrow morning.     meantime     tell Ulysses
  your course,     explain everything   him       prevent
your suffering   misadventure either   land   sea.'

"  agreed       she had said,   feasted through   livelong
day     going down     sun, but when   sun had set    
came   dark,   men laid themselves down   sleep     stern cables
    ship. Then Circe took       hand   bade     seated
away     others, while she reclined     side   asked    
  our adventures. 

"'  far   good,' said she, when   had ended   story, '  now pay
attention       am     tell  - heaven itself, indeed,  
recall     your recollection. First     come     Sirens

"'When your crew   taken   past these Sirens,   cannot give

"'    find   other rocks lie lower, but   are   close together

when she is sucking,       are, Neptune himself could   save
 ;   must hug   Scylla side   drive ship     fast

"'Is   no way,' said  , '  escaping Charybdis,       same
time keeping Scylla off when she is trying   harm   men?'

"'  dare devil,' replied   goddess,   are always wanting  
fight somebody   something;       let yourself   beaten even
    immortals.   Scylla is   mortal; moreover she is savage,
extreme, rude, cruel   invincible.   is no help    ; your
best chance               fast   ever   can,

"'    now come     Thrinacian island,   here     see
many herds   cattle   flocks   sheep belonging     sun god-
seven herds   cattle   seven flocks   sheep,   fifty head  
each flock.       breed, nor     become fewer   number,
    are tended     goddesses Phaethusa   Lampetie,   are
children     sun god Hyperion   Neaera.   mother when she

father   flocks   herds.     leave these flocks unharmed,  
think   nothing but getting home,   may yet after much hardship
reach Ithaca; but     harm them, then   forewarn       destruction
both   your ship     your comrades;   even though   may yourself
escape,     return late,   bad plight, after losing   your
men.' 

"Here she ended,   dawn enthroned   gold began   show   heaven,
whereon she returned inland.   then went   board   told   men
  loose   ship     moorings;       once got into  ,
took   places,   began   smite   grey sea     oars.
Presently   great   cunning goddess Circe befriended us    
fair wind   blew dead aft,   stayed steadily   us, keeping
our sails well filled,     did whatever wanted doing     ship  
gear,   let       wind   helmsman headed  . 

"Then, being much troubled   mind,   said     men, '  friends,
  is   right       two   us alone should know   prophecies
  Circe has made  ,     therefore tell     them,    
whether   live   die   may       our eyes open. First she
said   were   keep clear     Sirens,   sit   sing most beautifully
    field   flowers; but she said   might hear them myself   long
  no   else did. Therefore, take     bind       crosspiece
half way     mast; bind       stand upright,     bond   fast
    cannot possibly break away,   lash   rope   ends    
mast itself.     beg   pray     set   free, then bind   more
tightly still.' 

"  had hardly finished telling everything     men before   reached
  island     two Sirens,     wind had been very favourable.
Then       sudden   fell dead calm;   was     breath  
wind nor   ripple upon   water,     men furled   sails  
stowed them; then taking     oars   whitened   water  
  foam   raised   rowing. Meanwhile   look   large wheel  
wax   cut     small     sword. Then   kneaded   wax    
strong hands till   became soft,     soon did between   kneading
    rays     sun god son   Hyperion. Then   stopped   ears
      men,     bound   hands   feet     mast     stood
upright     crosspiece; but   went   rowing themselves. When
  had got within earshot     land,     ship was going    
good rate,   Sirens saw     were getting   shore   began
    singing. 

"'Come here,'   sang, 'renowned Ulysses, honour     Achaean
name,   listen   our two voices. No   ever sailed past us without
staying   hear   enchanting sweetness   our song-       listens
        way   only charmed, but wiser,     know    
ills     gods laid upon   Argives   Trojans before Troy,
  can tell   everything   is going   happen over   whole
world.' 

"  sang these words most musically,       longed   hear them
further   made   frowning     men     should set   free;
but   quickened   stroke,   Eurylochus   Perimedes bound
    still stronger bonds till   had got     hearing    
Sirens' voices. Then   men took   wax     ears   unbound
 . 

"Immediately after   had got past   island   saw   great wave  
  spray was rising,     heard   loud roaring sound.   men
were   frightened     loosed hold     oars,     whole
sea resounded     rushing     waters, but   ship stayed
where   was,     men had left off rowing.   went round, therefore,
  exhorted them man   man     lose heart. 

"'  friends,' said  , '  is     first time       been
  danger,     are   nothing like   bad   case   when   Cyclops
shut us       cave; nevertheless,   courage   wise counsel
saved us then,     shall live   look back         well.
Now, therefore, let us          , trust   Jove   row    
might   main.      , coxswain, these are your orders; attend
  them,     ship is   your hands; turn   head away   these
steaming rapids   hug   rock,   she   give     slip  
  over yonder before   know where   are,          
death   us.' 

"    did     told them; but   said nothing     awful monster
Scylla,     knew   men       rowing     did, but  
huddle together     hold.     thing only did   disobey Circe  
strict instructions-   put     armour. Then seizing two strong spears
  took   stand     ship Is bows,     was       expected
first   see   monster     rock,   was       men   much
harm; but   could   make     anywhere, though   strained  
eyes   looking   gloomy rock   over   over 

"Then   entered   Straits   great fear   mind,        
hand was Scylla,       other dread Charybdis kept sucking  
  salt water.   she vomited    ,   was like   water     cauldron
when   is boiling over upon   great fire,     spray reached  
top     rocks   either side. When she began   suck again,  
could see   water   inside whirling round   round,     made
  deafening sound     broke against   rocks.   could see  
bottom     whirlpool   black   sand   mud,     men were
    wit   ends   fear. While   were taken      ,  
were expecting each moment     our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly
upon us   snatched     six best men.   was looking   once after
both ship   men,       moment   saw   hands   feet ever
  high above  , struggling     air   Scylla was carrying them
off,     heard them call     name     last despairing cry.
    fisherman, seated, spear   hand, upon some jutting rock throws
bait into   water   deceive   poor little fishes,   spears
them     ox   horn       spear is shod, throwing them
gasping       land     catches them      - even   did
Scylla land these panting creatures     rock   munch them  
    mouth     den, while   screamed   stretched    
hands         mortal agony.   was   most sickening sight
    saw throughout     voyages. 

"When   had passed   [Wandering] rocks,   Scylla   terrible
Charybdis,   reached   noble island     sun god, where were
  goodly cattle   sheep belonging     sun Hyperion. While still
  sea     ship   could bear   cattle lowing     came home
    yards,     sheep bleating. Then   remembered     blind
Theban prophet Teiresias had told  ,   how carefully Aeaean Circe
had warned     shun   island     blessed sun god.   being
much troubled   said     men, '  men,   know   are hard pressed,
but listen while   tell     prophecy   Teiresias made  ,  
how carefully Aeaean Circe warned     shun   island     blessed
sun god,     was here, she said,   our worst danger   lie.
Head   ship, therefore, away     island.' 

"  men were   despair    ,   Eurylochus   once gave    
insolent answer. 'Ulysses,' said  , '  are cruel;   are very
strong yourself   never   worn  ;   seem     made   iron,
  now, though your men are exhausted   toil   want   sleep,
      let them land   cook themselves   good supper upon
  island, but bid them put     sea     faring fruitlessly
  through   watches     flying night.   is   night    
winds blow hardest       much damage; how can   escape should
    those sudden squalls spring     South West   West,  
  often wreck   vessel when our lords   gods are unpropitious?
Now, therefore, let us obey     night   prepare our supper here
hard     ship;   morrow morning         board again  
put     sea.' 

"Thus spoke Eurylochus,     men approved   words.   saw  
heaven meant us   mischief   said, '  force     yield,    
are many against  , but   any rate each       must take  
solemn oath       meet     herd   cattle     large flock
  sheep,           mad     kill   single head   either,
but     satisfied     food   Circe has given us.'

"    swore     bade them,   when   had completed  
oath   made   ship fast     harbour   was near   stream  
fresh water,     men went ashore   cooked   suppers.  
soon     had had enough   eat   drink,   began talking  
  poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched     eaten;   set
them weeping     went   crying till   fell off into   sound
sleep. 

"    third watch     night when   stars had shifted  
places, Jove raised   great gale   wind   flew   hurricane  
  land   sea were covered   thick clouds,   night sprang
forth       heavens. When   child   morning, rosy fingered
Dawn, appeared,   brought   ship   land   drew   into   cave
wherein   sea nymphs hold   courts   dances,     called
  men together   council. 

"'  friends,' said  , '    meat   drink     ship, let us
mind, therefore,     touch   cattle,     shall suffer  
 ;   these cattle   sheep belong     mighty sun,   sees
  gives ear   everything.   again   promised      
obey. 

"    whole month   wind blew steadily     South,    
was no other wind, but only South   East.   long   corn   wine
held     men did   touch   cattle when   were hungry; when,
however,   had eaten     was     ship,   were forced
    further afield,   hook   line, catching birds,   taking
whatever   could lay   hands  ;     were starving.  
day, therefore,   went   inland     might pray heaven   show
  some means   getting away. When   had gone far enough     clear
      men,   had found   place   was well sheltered  
  wind,   washed   hands   prayed       gods   Olympus
till         sent   off into   sweet sleep. 

"Meanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel     men, 'Listen
   ,' said  , '  poor comrades.   deaths are bad enough but
  is none   bad   famine. Why should     drive     best
  these cows   offer them   sacrifice     immortal Rods?  
  ever   back   Ithaca,   can build   fine temple     sun god
  enrich     every kind   ornament;  , however,   is determined
  sink our ship     revenge   these homed cattle,     other
gods are     same mind,         rather drink salt water
once         done    , than   starved   death   inches
  such   desert island     is.' 

"Thus spoke Eurylochus,     men approved   words. Now   cattle,
  fair   goodly, were feeding   far     ship;   men, therefore
drove     best   them,       stood round them saying  
prayers,   using young oak shoots instead   barley meal,    
was no barley left. When   had done praying   killed   cows
  dressed   carcasses;   cut     thigh bones, wrapped
them round   two layers   fat,   set some pieces   raw meat  
top   them.   had no wine       make drink offerings over
  sacrifice while   was cooking,     kept pouring     little
water   time   time while   inward meats were being grilled;
then, when   thigh bones were burned     had tasted   inward
meats,   cut   rest   small   put   pieces upon   spits.

"    time   deep sleep had left  ,     turned back    
ship       sea shore.     drew near   began   smell hot roast
meat,     groaned     prayer     immortal gods. 'Father Jove,'
  exclaimed, '      other gods   live   everlasting bliss,
    done     cruel mischief     sleep into      
sent  ; see   fine work these men   mine   been making  
  absence.' 

"Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off     sun   told him   had
been killing   cows, whereon   flew into   great rage,   said
    immortals, 'Father Jove,       other gods   live  
everlasting bliss,   must   vengeance     crew   Ulysses' ship:
    had   insolence   kill   cows,   were     thing
  loved   look upon, whether   was going   heaven   down again.
        square accounts         cows,       down
  Hades   shine   among   dead.' 

"'Sun,' said Jove, '    shining upon us gods   upon mankind over
  fruitful earth.     shiver   ship into little pieces  
  bolt   white lightning   soon           sea.'

"  was told       Calypso,   said she had heard      
mouth   Mercury. 

"  soon     got down     ship       sea shore   rebuked each
      men separately, but   could see no way      ,  
  cows were dead already.   indeed   gods began   once   show
signs   wonders among us,     hides     cattle crawled  ,
    joints upon   spits began   low like cows,     meat,
whether cooked   raw, kept   making   noise just   cows  .

"  six days   men kept driving     best cows   feasting upon
them, but when Jove   son   Saturn had added   seventh day,  
fury     gale abated;   therefore went   board, raised our masts,
spread sail,   put     sea.   soon     were well away  
  island,   could see nothing but sky   sea,   son   Saturn
raised   black cloud over our ship,     sea grew dark beneath
 .         much further,     another moment   were caught
    terrific squall     West   snapped   forestays    
mast       fell aft, while     ship   gear tumbled  
    bottom     vessel.   mast fell upon   head     helmsman
    ship   stern,       bones     head were crushed  
pieces,     fell overboard   though   were diving,   no more
life left   him. 

"Then Jove let fly     thunderbolts,     ship went round
  round,   was filled   fire   brimstone     lightning
struck  .   men   fell into   sea;   were carried  
    water round   ship, looking like   many sea gulls, but  
god presently deprived them     chance   getting home again.

"  stuck     ship till   sea knocked   sides     keel

"[  gale     West had now spent its force,     wind got
into   South again,   frightened   lest   should   taken back

"Hence   was carried along   nine days till     tenth night

BOOK XIII

Thus did   speak,       held   peace throughout   covered
cloister, enthralled     charm     story, till presently Alcinous
began   speak. 

"Ulysses," said  , "now       reached   house   doubt  
      home without further misadventure no matter how much
    suffered     past.     others, however,   come here
night after night   drink   choicest wine   listen     bard,
    insist   follows. Our guest has already packed     clothes,
wrought gold,   other valuables       brought     acceptance;
let us now, therefore, present him further, each     us,    
large tripod     cauldron.     recoup ourselves     levy
    general rate;   private individuals cannot   expected   bear
  burden   such   handsome present." 

Every   approved    ,   then   went home   bed each  
  own abode. When   child   morning, rosy fingered Dawn, appeared,
  hurried down     ship   brought   cauldrons   them.
Alcinous went   board   saw everything   securely stowed under
  ship   benches   nothing could break adrift   injure  
rowers. Then   went     house   Alcinous     dinner,  
  sacrificed   bull   them   honour   Jove   is   lord  
 .   set   steaks   grill   made   excellent dinner, after
    inspired bard, Demodocus,   was   favourite   every
 , sang   them; but Ulysses kept   turning   eyes towards  
sun,   though   hasten   setting,     was longing      
  way.       has been   day ploughing   fallow field  
  couple   oxen keeps thinking     supper   is glad when
night comes     may        ,     is     legs can
    carry him, even   did Ulysses rejoice when   sun went down,
      once said     Phaecians, addressing himself more particularly
  King Alcinous: 

"Sir,        , farewell. Make your drink offerings   send
      way rejoicing,       fulfilled   heart   desire  
giving     escort,   making   presents,   heaven grant  
  may turn   good account; may   find   admirable wife living  
peace among friends,   may   whom   leave behind   give satisfaction
  your wives   children; may heaven vouchsafe   every good grace,
  may no evil thing come among your people." 

Thus did   speak.   hearers     them approved   saying  
agreed     should     escort inasmuch     had spoken reasonably.
Alcinous therefore said     servant, "Pontonous, mix some wine
  hand   round   everybody,     may offer   prayer   father
Jove,   speed our guest upon   way." 

Pontonous mixed   wine   handed     every     turn;   others
each     own seat made   drink offering     blessed gods  
live   heaven, but Ulysses rose   placed   double cup    
hands   queen Arete. 

"Farewell, queen," said  , "henceforward     ever, till age  
death,   common lot   mankind, lay   hands upon  .   now
take   leave;   happy     house   your children, your people,
    king Alcinous." 

    spoke   crossed   threshold,   Alcinous sent   man   conduct
him     ship       sea shore. Arete also sent some maid servants
  him-       clean shirt   cloak, another   carry   strong box,
    third   corn   wine. When   got     water side  
crew took these things   put them   board,       meat  
drink; but   Ulysses   spread   rug     linen sheet   deck
    might sleep soundly     stern     ship. Then   too
went   board   lay down without   word, but   crew took every
man   place   loosed   hawser     pierced stone    
  had been bound. Thereon, when   began rowing     sea, Ulysses
fell into   deep, sweet,   almost deathlike slumber. 

  ship bounded forward     way     four   hand chariot flies
over   course when   horses feel   whip.   prow curveted  
  were   neck     stallion,     great wave   dark blue water
seethed     wake. She held steadily     course,   even   falcon,
swiftest     birds, could     kept pace    . Thus, then,
she cut   way through   water. carrying     was   cunning
    gods, but   was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful    
    had suffered both     field   battle       waves
    weary sea. 

When   bright star   heralds   approach   dawn began   show.
  ship drew near   land. Now   is   Ithaca   haven    
old merman Phorcys,   lies between two points   break   line
    sea   shut   harbour  . These shelter       storms
  wind   sea   rage outside,    , when once within  ,  
ship may lie without being even moored.     head     harbour
  is   large olive tree,     no distance   fine overarching

Into   harbour, then,   took   ship,     knew   place,
She had   much way upon     she ran half   own length    
  shore; when, however,   had landed,   first thing   did
was   lift Ulysses     rug   linen sheet       ship,
  lay him down upon   sand still fast asleep. Then   took  
  presents   Minerva had persuaded   Phaeacians   give him
when   was setting       voyage homewards.   put these  
together     root     olive tree, away     road,   fear
some passer   might come   steal them before Ulysses awoke;  
then   made   best     way home again. 

But Neptune did   forget   threats       had already threatened
Ulysses,     took counsel   Jove. "Father Jove," said  , " 
shall no longer   held   any sort   respect among   gods,  
mortals like   Phaeacians,   are   own flesh   blood, show
such small regard    .   said     Ulysses   home when  
had suffered sufficiently.   did         should never  
home    ,     knew   had already nodded your head    ,
  promised     should    ; but now     brought him  
  ship fast asleep     landed him   Ithaca after loading him
  more magnificent presents   bronze, gold,   raiment than  
  ever   brought back   Troy,     had had   share  
  spoil   got home without misadventure." 

  Jove answered, " ,   Lord     Earthquake, are   talking
 ?   gods are   no means wanting   respect    .    
  monstrous were     insult     old   honoured     are.
  regards mortals, however,   any   them is indulging   insolence
  treating   disrespectfully,     always rest   yourself
  deal   him     may think proper,     just     please."

"  should   done     once," replied Neptune, "    were   anxious
  avoid anything   might displease  ; now, therefore,   should
like   wreck   Phaecian ship     is returning   its escort.
    stop them   escorting people   future;     should
also like   bury   city under   huge mountain." 

"  good friend," answered Jove, "  should recommend       very
moment when   people     city are watching   ship    
way,   turn   into   rock near   land   looking like   ship.
    astonish everybody,     can then bury   city under
  mountain." 

When earth encircling Neptune heard     went   Scheria where
  Phaecians live,   stayed   till   ship,   was making
rapid way, had got close  . Then   went      , turned   into
stone,   drove   down     flat     hand       root  
    ground. After     went away. 

  Phaeacians then began talking among themselves,      
turn towards   neighbour, saying, "Bless   heart,   is    
can   rooted   ship     sea just   she was getting into port?
  could see   whole     only moment ago." 

  was how   talked, but   knew nothing    ;   Alcinous
said, "  remember now   old prophecy     father.   said  
Neptune     angry   us   taking every     safely over
  sea,       day wreck   Phaeacian ship     was returning
    escort,   bury our city under   high mountain.   was
    old father used    ,   now   is   coming true. Now
therefore let us          ;     first place   must leave
off giving people escorts when   come here,       next let
us sacrifice twelve picked bulls   Neptune     may   mercy
upon us,     bury our city under   high mountain." When  
people heard     were afraid   got ready   bulls.

Thus did   chiefs   rulers     Phaecians   king Neptune, standing
round   altar;       same time Ulysses woke   once more upon
  own soil.   had been   long away     did   know   again;
moreover, Jove   daughter Minerva had made     foggy day,    
people might   know     having come,     she might tell
him everything without either   wife     fellow citizens  
friends recognizing him until   had taken   revenge upon   wicked
suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different   him-  
long straight tracks,   harbours,   precipices,     goodly
trees, appeared   changed     started     looked upon   native
land.     smote   thighs     flat     hands   cried
aloud despairingly. 

"Alas,"   exclaimed, "among   manner   people am   fallen? Are
  savage   uncivilized   hospitable   humane? Where shall
  put     treasure,     way shall    ?   wish   had stayed
over       Phaeacians;     could   gone   some other
great chief       been good       given     escort.
    is       know where   put   treasure,     cannot leave
  here   fear somebody else should   hold    .   good truth
  chiefs   rulers     Phaeacians     been dealing fairly
   ,     left       wrong country;   said    
take   back   Ithaca         done  : may Jove   protector
  suppliants chastise them,     watches over everybody   punishes
those     wrong. Still,   suppose   must count   goods   see
    crew   gone off   any   them." 

  counted   goodly coppers   cauldrons,   gold      
clothes, but   was nothing missing; still   kept grieving  
  being     own country,   wandered     down     shore
    sounding sea bewailing   hard fate. Then Minerva came  
  him disguised     young shepherd   delicate   princely mien,
    good cloak folded double     shoulders; she had sandals
    comely feet   held   javelin     hand. Ulysses was glad
when   saw  ,   went straight      . 

"  friend," said  , "  are   first person whom     met  
    country;   salute  , therefore,   beg         disposed
towards  . Protect these   goods,   myself too,     embrace
your knees   pray       though   were   god. Tell  , then,
  tell   truly,   land   country is  ?   are its inhabitants?
Am       island,   is     sea board   some continent?"

Minerva answered, "Stranger,   must   very simple,   must  
come   somewhere   long way off,     know   country  
is.   is   very celebrated place,   everybody knows   East  
West.   is rugged       good driving country, but   is   no
means   bid island       is    .   grows any quantity
  corn   also wine,     is watered both   rain   dew;  
breeds cattle also   goats;   kinds   timber grow here,    
are watering places where   water never runs dry;  , sir,   name
  Ithaca is known even   far   Troy,     understand      
long way off     Achaean country." 

Ulysses was glad   finding himself,   Minerva told him,     own
country,     began   answer, but   did   speak   truth,  
made     lying story     instinctive wiliness     heart.

"  heard   Ithaca," said  , "when   was   Crete beyond   seas,
  now   seems     reached       these treasures.    
left   much more behind       children, but am flying because
  killed Orsilochus son   Idomeneus,   fleetest runner   Crete.
  killed him because   wanted   rob       spoils   had got  
Troy     much trouble   danger both     field   battle  
    waves     weary sea;   said   had   served   father
loyally   Troy   vassal, but had set myself       independent
ruler,     lay   wait   him           followers    
road side,   speared him     was coming into town     country.
    was   very dark night   nobody saw us;   was   known, therefore,
    had killed him, but   soon     had done     went     ship
  besought   owners,   were Phoenicians,   take     board
  set     Pylos     Elis where   Epeans rule, giving them
  much spoil   satisfied them.   meant no guile, but   wind
drove them off   course,     sailed   till   came hither
  night.   was     could       inside   harbour,   none
  us said   word   supper though   wanted   badly, but    
went   shore   lay down just     were.   was very tired   fell
asleep directly,     took   goods       ship,   placed
them beside   where   was lying upon   sand. Then   sailed away
  Sidonia,     was left here   great distress   mind."

Such was   story, but Minerva smiled   caressed him     hand.
Then she took   form     woman, fair, stately,   wise, "  must
  indeed   shifty lying fellow," said she, "  could surpass  
    manner   craft even though   had   god   your antagonist.
Dare devil     are, full   guile, unwearying   deceit, can
    drop your tricks   your instinctive falsehood, even now
    are   your own country again?       no more, however,
   ,     can both   us deceive upon occasion-   are  
most accomplished counsellor   orator among   mankind, while  
  diplomacy   subtlety   no equal among   gods. Did    
know Jove   daughter Minerva-  ,     been ever    ,  
kept watch over       your troubles,     made   Phaeacians
take   great   liking    ?   now, again,   am come here   talk
things over    ,   help     hide   treasure   made  
Phaeacians give  ;   want   tell       troubles   await
    your own house;     got   face them, but tell no  ,
neither man nor woman,       come home again. Bear everything,
  put     every man   insolence, without   word." 

  Ulysses answered, "  man, goddess, may know   great deal, but
  are   constantly changing your appearance   when   meets
    is   hard matter   him   know whether   is      .
  much, however,   know exceedingly well;   were very kind  
    long     Achaeans were fighting before Troy, but    
day       went   board ship after having sacked   city  
Priam,   heaven dispersed us-     day, Minerva,   saw no more
   ,   cannot ever remember your coming     ship   help  
    difficulty;   had   wander   sick   sorry till   gods delivered
    evil     reached   city     Phaeacians, where   encouraged
    took   into   town.   now,   beseech     your father  
name, tell     truth,         believe   am really back  
Ithaca.   am   some other country     are mocking     deceiving
          been saying. Tell   then truly,     really
got back     own country?" 

"  are always taking something     sort into your head," replied
Minerva, "    is why   cannot desert     your afflictions;
  are   plausible, shrewd   shifty. Any   but yourself   returning
    long   voyage     once   gone home   see   wife
  children, but       seem   care   asking after them
  hearing any news   them till     exploited your wife,
  remains   home vainly grieving    ,   having no peace night
  day     tears she sheds   your behalf.         coming
near  ,   was never uneasy    ,     was certain    
  back safely though     lose   your men,     did  
wish   quarrel     uncle Neptune,   never forgave     having
blinded   son.     now, however, point         lie  
  land,       then perhaps believe  .   is   haven
    old merman Phorcys,   here is   olive tree   grows  
  head    ; [near   is   cave sacred     Naiads;] here too
is   overarching cavern         offered many   acceptable
hecatomb     nymphs,     is   wooded mountain Neritum."

  she spoke   goddess dispersed   mist     land appeared.
Then Ulysses rejoiced   finding himself again     own land,  
kissed   bounteous soil;   lifted     hands   prayed    
nymphs, saying, "Naiad nymphs, daughters   Jove,   made sure  
  was never again   see  , now therefore   greet       loving
salutations,       bring   offerings       old days,  
Jove   redoubtable daughter   grant   life,   bring   son  
manhood." 

"Take heart,       trouble yourself    ," rejoined Minerva,
"let us rather set   stowing your things   once     cave,
where       quite safe. Let us see how   can best manage  
 ." 

Therewith she went down into   cave   look     safest hiding
places, while Ulysses brought       treasure   gold, bronze,
  good clothing     Phaecians had given him.   stowed everything
carefully away,   Minerva set   stone against   door     cave.
Then   two sat down     root     great olive,   consulted
how   compass   destruction     wicked suitors. 

"Ulysses," said Minerva, "noble son   Laertes, think how   can
lay hands   these disreputable people     been lording    
your house these three years, courting your wife   making wedding
presents    , while she does nothing but lament your absence, giving
hope   sending your encouraging messages   every     them, but
meaning   very opposite     she says' 

  Ulysses answered, "  good truth, goddess,   seems   should  
come   much   same bad end     own house   Agamemnon did,  
  had   given   such timely information. Advise   how   shall
best avenge myself. Stand     side   put your courage into  
heart       day when   loosed Troy   fair diadem     brow.
Help   now     did then,       fight three hundred men,  
 , goddess,        ." 

"Trust      ," said she, "      lose sight     when
once   set    ,       imagine   some   those   are
devouring your substance   then bespatter   pavement    
blood   brains.     begin   disguising       no human
being shall know  ;     cover your body   wrinkles;   shall
lose   your yellow hair;     clothe       garment   shall
fill     see     loathing;     blear your fine eyes  
 ,   make     unseemly object     sight     suitors,
  your wife,       son whom   left behind  . Then    
once     swineherd   is   charge   your pigs;   has been always
well affected towards  ,   is devoted   Penelope   your son;
    find him feeding   pigs near   rock   is called Raven
    fountain Arethusa, where   are fattening   beechmast  
spring water after   manner. Stay   him   find   how things
are going, while   proceed   Sparta   see your son,   is  
Menelaus   Lacedaemon, where   has gone   try   find   whether
  are still alive." 

"But why," said Ulysses, "did     tell him,     knew    
 ? Did   want him too     sailing   amid   kinds   hardship
while others are eating     estate?" 

Minerva answered, "Never mind   him,   sent him     might
  well spoken     having gone.   is   no sort   difficulty,
but is staying quite comfortably   Menelaus,   is surrounded
  abundance   every kind.   suitors   put     sea  
are lying   wait   him,     mean   kill him before   can
  home.       much think     succeed, but rather   some
  those   are now eating   your estate   first find   grave
themselves." 

  she spoke Minerva touched him     wand   covered him  
wrinkles, took away     yellow hair,   withered   flesh over
  whole body; she bleared   eyes,   were naturally very fine
ones; she changed   clothes   threw   old rag     wrap  
him,     tunic, tattered, filthy,   begrimed   smoke; she also
gave him   undressed deer skin     outer garment,   furnished
him     staff     wallet     holes,     twisted thong  
him   sling   over   shoulder. 

When   pair had thus laid   plans   parted,     goddess
went straight   Lacedaemon   fetch Telemachus.

BOOK XIV

Ulysses now left   haven,   took   rough track   through  
wooded country   over   crest     mountain till   reached
  place where Minerva had said       find   swineherd,
  was   most thrifty servant   had.   found him sitting   front
    hut,   was     yards     had built     site  
could   seen   far.   had made them spacious   fair   see,
    free ran     pigs   round them;   had built them during
  master   absence,   stones     had gathered       ground,
without saying anything   Penelope   Laertes,     had fenced
them   top   thorn bushes. Outside   yard   had run   strong
fence   oaken posts, split,   set pretty close together, while
inside lie had built twelve sties near   another     sows  
lie  .   were fifty pigs wallowing   each sty,     them breeding
sows; but   boars slept outside   were much fewer   number,  
  suitors kept   eating them,   die swineherd had   send them
  best   had continually.   were three hundred   sixty boar
pigs,     herdsman   four hounds,   were   fierce   wolves,
slept always   them.   swineherd was     moment cutting  
  pair   sandals     good stout ox hide. Three     men were
  herding   pigs     place   another,     had sent  
fourth   town     boar     had been forced   send   suitors
    might sacrifice         fill   meat.

When   hounds saw Ulysses   set     furious barking   flew
  him, but Ulysses was cunning enough   sit down   loose   hold
    stick     had     hand: still,       been torn
  them     own homestead had     swineherd dropped   ox
hide, rushed full speed through   gate     yard   driven  
dogs off   shouting   throwing stones   them. Then   said  
Ulysses, "Old man,   dogs were likely     made short work  
 ,   then       got   into trouble.   gods   given
  quite enough worries without  ,       lost   best  
masters,   am   continual grief     account.       attend
swine   other people   eat, while  ,     yet lives   see  
light   day, is starving   some distant land. But come inside,  
when     had your fill   bread   wine, tell   where   come
 ,       your misfortunes." 

      swineherd led   way into   hut   bade him sit down.
  strewed   good thick bed   rushes upon   floor,       top
      threw   shaggy chamois skin-   great thick  -    
  used   sleep   night. Ulysses was pleased   being made thus
welcome,   said "May Jove, sir,     rest     gods grant  
your heart   desire   return     kind way         received
 ." 

      answered,   swineherd Eumaeus, "Stranger, though   still
poorer man should come here,         right       insult
him,     strangers   beggars are   Jove.   must take  
  can       thankful,   servants live   fear when    
young lords     masters;     is   misfortune now,  
heaven has hindered   return   him       been always good
      given   something     own-   house,   piece   land,
  good looking wife,     else     liberal master allows   servant
  has worked hard   him,   whose labour   gods   prospered
      mine     situation     hold.     master had
grown old here       done great things    , but   is gone,
    wish   Helen   whole race were utterly destroyed,   she
has been   death   many   good man.   was   matter   took
  master   Ilius,   land   noble steeds,   fight   Trojans
    cause   kin Agamemnon." 

    spoke   bound   girdle round him   went     sties where
  young sucking pigs were penned.   picked   two     brought
back   him   sacrificed.   singed them, cut them  ,   spitted
  them; when   meat was cooked   brought         set  
before Ulysses, hot   still     spit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled
  over   white barley meal.   swineherd then mixed wine    
bowl   ivy wood,   taking   seat opposite Ulysses told him   begin.

"Fall  , stranger," said  , "    dish   servant   pork.   fat
pigs           suitors,   eat them   without shame   scruple;
but   blessed gods love   such shameful doings,   respect those
      is lawful   right. Even   fierce free booters  
  raiding   other people   land,   Jove gives them   spoil-
even  , when     filled   ships   got home again live
conscience stricken,   look fearfully   judgement; but some god
seems     told these people   Ulysses is dead   gone;  
   , therefore,   back     own homes   make   offers
  marriage     usual way, but waste   estate   force, without
fear   stint.     day   night comes     heaven, but   sacrifice
    victim nor two only,     take   run     wine,

  mainland is   rich     was;   had   much   twenty men put
together.     tell       had.   are twelve herds   cattle
upon   mainland,     many flocks   sheep,   are also twelve
droves   pigs, while   own men   hired strangers feed him twelve
widely spreading herds   goats. Here   Ithaca   runs even large
flocks   goats     far end     island,     are    
charge   excellent goatherds. Each     these sends   suitors
  best goat     flock every day.     myself,   am   charge
    pigs     see here,         keep picking    
best       sending     them." 

  was   story, but Ulysses went   eating   drinking ravenously
without   word, brooding   revenge. When   had eaten enough  
was satisfied,   swineherd took   bowl       usually drank,
filled     wine,   gave     Ulysses,   was pleased,  
said     took       hands, "  friend,   was   master  
yours   bought     paid    ,   rich     powerful  
  tell  ?       perished     cause   King Agamemnon; tell
      was,   case   may   met   such   person. Jove  
  other gods know, but   may   able   give   news   him,  
    travelled much." 

Eumaeus answered, "Old man, no traveller   comes here   news
    Ulysses' wife   son   believe   story. Nevertheless,
tramps   want     lodging keep coming     mouths full  
lies,       word   truth; every     finds   way   Ithaca
goes     mistress   tells   falsehoods, whereon she takes them
 , makes much   them,   asks them   manner   questions, crying
    time   women   when     lost   husbands.  
  too, old man,     shirt     cloak   doubtless make  
  very pretty story. But   wolves   birds   prey   long since
torn Ulysses   pieces,     fishes     sea   eaten him,  
  bones are lying buried deep   sand upon some foreign shore;  
is dead   gone,     bad business   is       friends-  
  especially;   where   may   shall never find   good   master,
  even     were     home     mother   father where   was
bred   born.         much care, however,     parents now,
though   should dearly like   see them again     own country;  
is   loss   Ulysses   grieves   most;   cannot speak   him
without reverence though   is here no longer,     was very fond
   ,   took such care       whereever   may     shall always
honour   memory." 

"  friend," replied Ulysses, "  are very positive,   very hard
  belief   your master   coming home again, nevertheless    
  merely  , but   swear,     is coming.     give  
anything     news till   has actually come,   may then give

  Ulysses         now come,       surely happen  
    said    . Ulysses   return     self same year;  
  end     moon     beginning     next       here
    vengeance     those   are ill treating   wife   son."

      answered,   swineherd Eumaeus, "Old man,     neither
  paid   bringing good news, nor   Ulysses ever come home;
drink   wine   peace,   let us talk   something else.  
  keep   reminding        ;   always pains   when any
  speaks     honoured master.     your oath     let
  alone, but   only wish   may come,     Penelope,   old father
Laertes,     son Telemachus.   am terribly unhappy too    
same boy    ;   was running   fast into manhood,   bade fare
    no worse man, face   figure, than   father, but some  ,
either god   man, has been unsettling   mind,     has gone off
  Pylos   try     news     father,     suitors are lying
  wait   him     is coming home,     hope   leaving   house
  Arceisius without   name   Ithaca. But let us   no more  
him,   leave him     taken,   else   escape     son   Saturn
holds   hand over him   protect him.   now, old man, tell  
your own story; tell   also,     want   know,     are  
where   come  . Tell     your town   parents,   manner
  ship   came  , how crew brought     Ithaca,      
country   professed   come-     cannot   come   land."

  Ulysses answered, "    tell        .     were
meat   wine enough,     could stay here     hut   nothing
    but   eat   drink while   others       work,   could
easily talk       whole twelve months without ever finishing  
story     sorrows       has pleased heaven   visit  .

"  am   birth   Cretan;   father was   well     man,   had many
sons born   marriage, whereas   was   son     slave whom   had
purchased     concubine; nevertheless,   father Castor son   Hylax
(whose lineage   claim,     was held     highest honour among
  Cretans     wealth, prosperity,     valour     sons)
put       same level     brothers   had been born   wedlock.
When, however, death took him     house   Hades,   sons divided
  estate   cast lots     shares, but       gave   holding
  little else; nevertheless,   valour enabled     marry into
  rich family,     was   given   bragging,   shirking    
field   battle.   is   over now; still,     look     straw
  can see     ear was,       had trouble enough    
spare. Mars   Minerva made   doughty   war; when   had picked
  men   surprise   enemy     ambuscade   never gave death
  much     thought, but was   first   leap forward   spear
  whom   could overtake. Such was     battle, but   did   care
  farm work, nor   frugal home life   those     bring
  children.   delight was   ships, fighting, javelins,   arrows-
things   most men shudder   think  ; but   man likes   thing
  another another,     was     was most naturally inclined
 . Before   Achaeans went   Troy, nine times was     command
  men   ships   foreign service,     amassed much wealth.  
had   pick     spoil     first instance,   much more was
allotted     later  . 

"  house grew apace     became   great man among   Cretans, but
when Jove counselled   terrible expedition,       many perished,
  people required     Idomeneus   lead   ships   Troy,
    was no way      ,     insisted   our doing  .
    fought   nine whole years, but     tenth   sacked  
city   Priam   sailed home again   heaven dispersed us. Then  
was   Jove devised evil against  .   spent but   month happily
    children, wife,   property,   then   conceived   idea
  making   descent   Egypt,     fitted     fine fleet   manned
 .   had nine ships,     people flocked   fill them.   six
days       men made feast,     found them many victims both  
sacrifice     gods     themselves, but     seventh day  
went   board   set sail   Crete     fair North wind behind
us though   were going down   river. Nothing went ill   any  
our ships,     had no sickness   board, but sat where   were
  let   ships       wind   steersmen took them.     fifth
day   reached   river Aegyptus;     stationed   ships    
river, bidding   men stay   them   keep guard over them while
  sent   scouts   reconnoitre   every point   vantage.

"But   men disobeyed   orders, took     own devices,   ravaged
  land     Egyptians, killing   men,   taking   wives
  children captive.   alarm was soon carried     city,  
when   heard   war cry,   people came     daybreak till
  plain was filled   horsemen   foot soldiers      
gleam   armour. Then Jove spread panic among   men,      
no longer face   enemy,     found themselves surrounded.  
Egyptians killed many   us,   took   rest alive     forced
labour   them. Jove, however, put       mind     thus-  
  wish   had died then       Egypt instead,     was much
sorrow   store    -   took off   helmet   shield   dropped
  spear     hand; then   went straight       king   chariot,
clasped   knees   kissed them, whereon   spared   life, bade
    into   chariot,   took   weeping     own home. Many
made         ashen spears   tried   kil       fury,
but   king protected  ,     feared   wrath   Jove   protector
  strangers,   punishes those     evil. 

"  stayed     seven years   got together much money among
  Egyptians,       gave   something; but when   was now
going     eight years   came   certain Phoenician,   cunning
rascal,   had already committed   sorts   villainy,    
man talked   over into going   him   Phoenicia, where   house
    possessions lay.   stayed       whole twelve months,
but     end     time when months   days had gone   till
  same season had come round again,   set     board   ship bound
  Libya,     pretence     was   take   cargo along   him
    place, but really     might sell       slave   take
  money   fetched.   suspected   intention, but went   board
  him,     could   help  . 

"  ship ran before   fresh North wind till   had reached   sea
  lies between Crete   Libya;  , however, Jove counselled
  destruction,     soon     were well     Crete  
could see nothing but sea   sky,   raised   black cloud over our
ship     sea grew dark beneath  . Then Jove let fly    
thunderbolts     ship went round   round   was filled  
fire   brimstone     lightning struck  .   men fell   into
  sea;   were carried       water round   ship looking
like   many sea gulls, but   god presently deprived them    
chance   getting home again.   was   dismayed; Jove, however, sent
  ship   mast within   reach,   saved   life,     clung
   ,   drifted before   fury     gale. Nine days did   drift
but     darkness     tenth night   great wave bore      
  Thesprotian coast.   Pheidon king     Thesprotians entertained
  hospitably without charging   anything         son found
  when   was nearly dead   cold   fatigue, whereon   raised
      hand, took       father   house   gave   clothes
  wear. 

"    was     heard news   Ulysses,     king told    
had entertained him,   shown him much hospitality while   was  
  homeward journey.   showed   also   treasure   gold,  
wrought iron   Ulysses had got together.   was enough   keep
  family   ten generations,   much had   left     house  
king Pheidon. But   king said Ulysses had gone   Dodona    
might learn Jove   mind     god   high oak tree,   know whether
after   long   absence   should return   Ithaca openly,    
secret. Moreover   king swore     presence, making drink offerings
    own house     did  ,     ship was     water side,
    crew found,   should take him     own country.   sent
  off however before Ulysses returned,     happened      
Thesprotian ship sailing     wheat growing island   Dulichium,
    told those   charge         sure   take   safely  
King Acastus. 

"These men hatched   plot against         reduced    
  very extreme   misery,   when   ship had got some way  
  land   resolved   selling       slave.   stripped  
    shirt   cloak     was wearing,   gave   instead  
tattered old clouts       now see  ; then, towards nightfall,
  reached   tilled lands   Ithaca,       bound    
  strong rope fast     ship, while   went   shore     supper
    sea side. But   gods soon undid   bonds    ,   having
drawn   rags over   head   slid down   rudder into   sea, where
  struck     swam till   was well clear   them,   came ashore
near   thick wood       lay concealed.   were very angry  
  having escaped   went searching      , till   last  
thought   was no further use   went back     ship.   gods,
having hidden   thus easily, then took       good man   door-  
  seems     am     die yet awhile." 

      answered,   swineherd Eumaeus, "Poor unhappy stranger,
    found   story   your misfortunes extremely interesting,
but   part   Ulysses is   right;       never    
  believe  . Why should   man like       telling lies  
  way?   know       return     master.   gods    
    them detest him,         taken him before Troy,
  let him die   friends around him when   days     fighting
were done;   then   Achaeans     built   mound over  
ashes     son     been heir     renown, but now  
storm winds   spirited him away   know   whither. 

"        live       way here     pigs,   never  
    town unless when Penelope sends         arrival   some
news   Ulysses. Then     sit round   ask questions, both
those   grieve over   king   absence,   those   rejoice  
  because   can eat     property without paying    .  
  own part     never cared   asking anyone else since  
time when   was taken       Aetolian,   had killed   man  
come   long way till   last   reached   station,     was very
kind   him.   said   had seen Ulysses   Idomeneus among  
Cretans, refitting   ships   had been damaged     gale.  
said Ulysses   return     following summer   autumn    
men,         bring back much wealth.   now  ,   unfortunate
old man, since fate has brought       door,     try   flatter
      way   vain hopes.   is     any such reason  
  shall treat   kindly, but only     respect   Jove   god
  hospitality,   fearing him   pitying  ." 

Ulysses answered, "  see     are     unbelieving mind;    
given     oath,   yet       credit  ; let us then make
  bargain,   call     gods   heaven   witness  .   your
master comes home, give     cloak   shirt   good wear,   send
    Dulichium where   want    ; but     does   come      
   , set your men      ,   tell them   throw     yonder
precepice,     warning   tramps           country telling
lies." 

"    pretty figure   should cut then," replied Eumaeus, both now
  hereafter,     were   kill   after receiving   into   hut
  showing   hospitality.   should         prayers   good
earnest     did; but   is just supper time     hope   men  
come   directly,     may cook something savoury   supper."

Thus did   converse,   presently   swineherds came    
  pigs,   were then shut       night     sties,  
  tremendous squealing   made     were being driven into them.
But Eumaeus called     men   said, "Bring     best pig  
 ,     may sacrifice     stranger,       take toll
  him ourselves.     had trouble enough   long time feeding
pigs, while others reap   fruit   our labour." 

      began chopping firewood, while   others brought    
fine fat five year old boar pig,   set       altar. Eumaeus
did   forget   gods,     was   man   good principles,    
first thing   did was   cut bristles     pig   face   throw
them into   fire, praying       gods     did     Ulysses
might return home again. Then   clubbed   pig     billet  
oak     had kept back when   was chopping   firewood,  
stunned  , while   others slaughtered   singed  . Then  
cut    ,   Eumaeus began   putting raw pieces   each joint
    some     fat; these   sprinkled   barley meal,   laid
upon   embers;   cut   rest     meat   small, put   pieces
upon   spits   roasted them till   were done; when   had
taken them off   spits   threw them       dresser     heap.
  swineherd,   was   most equitable man, then stood     give
every     share.   made seven portions;     these   set apart
  Mercury   son   Maia     nymphs, praying   them    
did  ;   others   dealt       men man   man.   gave Ulysses
some slices cut lengthways down   loin     mark   especial honour,
  Ulysses was much pleased. "  hope, Eumaeus," said  , "  Jove
      well disposed towards       am,     respect  
are showing     outcast like myself." 

      answered,   swineherd Eumaeus, "Eat,   good fellow,  
enjoy your supper, such     is. God grants  ,   withholds  ,
just     thinks right,     can   whatever   chooses."

    spoke   cut off   first piece   offered       burnt sacrifice
    immortal gods; then   made them   drink offering, put  
cup     hands   Ulysses,   sat down     own portion. Mesaulius
brought them   bread;   swineherd had bought   man    
own account   among   Taphians during   master   absence,  
had paid   him     own money without saying anything either
    mistress   Laertes.   then laid   hands upon   good
things   were before them,   when   had had enough   eat
  drink, Mesaulius took away   was left     bread,    
  went   bed after having made   hearty supper. 

Now   night came   stormy   very dark,     was no moon.
  poured without ceasing,     wind blew strong     West,
  is   wet quarter,   Ulysses thought     see whether Eumaeus,
    excellent care   took   him,   take off   own cloak
  give   him,   make       men give him  . "Listen    ,"
said  , "Eumaeus     rest    ; when     said   prayer  
  tell   something.   is   wine   makes   talk    
way; wine   make even   wise man fall   singing;     make
him chuckle   dance     many   word     had better leave
unspoken; still,       begun,        .       were
still young   strong   when   got     ambuscade before Troy.
Menelaus   Ulysses were   leaders, but   was   command also,
    other two        . When   had come       wall
    city   crouched down beneath our armour   lay   under
cover     reeds   thick brush wood   grew     swamp.
  came     freeze     North wind blowing;   snow fell small
  fine like hoar frost,   our shields were coated thick   rime.
  others had   got cloaks   shirts,   slept comfortably enough
    shields     shoulders, but   had carelessly left
  cloak behind  ,   thinking     should   too cold,   had
gone off   nothing but   shirt   shield. When   night was two thirds
through     stars had shifted     places,   nudged Ulysses
  was close         elbow,       once gave     ear.

"'Ulysses,' said  , '  cold       death    ,      
no cloak; some god fooled   into setting off   nothing   but
  shirt,         know      .' 

"Ulysses,   was   crafty     was valiant, hit upon   following
plan: 

"'Keep still,' said       low voice, '    others   hear  .'
Then   raised   head     elbow. 

"'  friends,' said  , '    had   dream   heaven     sleep.
  are   long way     ships;   wish some       down  
tell Agamemnon   send us   more men   once.' 

"    Thoas son   Andraemon threw off   cloak   set   running
    ships, whereon   took   cloak   lay     comfortably enough
till morning.       were still young   strong     was  
those days,   then some       swineherds   give     cloak
both     good         respect due     brave soldier;
but now people look down upon   because   clothes are shabby."

  Eumaeus answered, "Old man,     told us   excellent story,
    said nothing   far but   is quite satisfactory;    
present, therefore,   shall want neither clothing nor anything else
    stranger   distress may reasonably expect, but   morrow morning
      shake your own old rags   your body again,    
    many spare cloaks nor shirts   here, but every man has only
 . When Ulysses' son comes home again     give   both cloak
  shirt,   send   wherever   may want    ." 

      got     made   bed   Ulysses   throwing some goatskins
  sheepskins     ground   front     fire. Here Ulysses lay
down,   Eumaeus covered him over     great heavy cloak    
kept     change   case   extraordinarily bad weather.

Thus did Ulysses sleep,     young men slept beside him. But  
swineherd did   like sleeping away     pigs,     got ready
      Ulysses was glad   see     looked after   property
during   master   absence. First   slung   sword over   brawny
shoulders   put     thick cloak   keep     wind.   also took
  skin     large   well fed goat,     javelin   case   attack
  men   dogs. Thus equipped   went     rest where   pigs
were camping under   overhanging rock   gave them shelter  
  North wind.

BOOK XV

But Minerva went     fair city   Lacedaemon   tell Ulysses'
son     was   return   once. She found him   Pisistratus sleeping
    forecourt   Menelaus   house; Pisistratus was fast asleep,
but Telemachus could   no rest   night   thinking     unhappy
father,   Minerva went close     him   said: 

"Telemachus,   should   remain   far away   home any longer,
nor leave your property   such dangerous people   your house;
    eat   everything     among them,        
been     fool   errand. Ask Menelaus   send   home   once  
  wish   find your excellent mother still   when     back.
  father   brothers are already urging     marry Eurymachus,
  has given   more than any     others,   has been greatly
increasing   wedding presents.   hope nothing valuable may  
been taken     house   spite    , but   know   women
are-   always want       best   can     man   marries
them,   never give another thought     children     first
husband, nor     father either when   is dead   done  .
  home, therefore,   put everything   charge     most respectable
woman servant      , until   shall please heaven   send
    wife   your own. Let   tell   also   another matter  
  had better attend  .   chief men among   suitors are lying
  wait         Strait between Ithaca   Samos,     mean
  kill   before   can reach home.       much think    
succeed;   is more likely   some   those   are now eating  
your property   find   grave themselves. Sail night   day,  
keep your ship well away     islands;   god   watches over
    protects     send     fair wind.   soon      
  Ithaca send your ship   men       town, but yourself   straight
    swineherd   has charge your pigs;   is well disposed towards
 , stay   him, therefore,     night,   then send him  
Penelope   tell         got back safe   Pylos."

Then she went back   Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus
    heel   rouse him,   said, "Wake   Pisistratus,   yoke
  horses     chariot,     must set off home." 

But Pisistratus said, "No matter   hurry   are     cannot drive
    dark.       morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought
  presents   put them     chariot   us;   let him   good bye
  us     usual way.   long     lives   guest should never forget
  host   has shown him kindness." 

    spoke day began   break,   Menelaus,   had already risen,
leaving Helen   bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him  
put     shirt   fast     could, threw   great cloak over  
shoulders,   went     meet him. "Menelaus," said  , "let  
  back now     own country,     want     home." 

  Menelaus answered, "Telemachus,     insist   going    
  detain  .   like   see   host either too fond     guest
  too rude   him. Moderation is best     things,     letting
  man   when   wants       is   bad   telling him      
    like   stay.   should treat   guest well   long    
is     house   speed him when   wants   leave  . Wait, then,
till   can   your beautiful presents into your chariot,   till
    yourself seen them.     tell   women   prepare   sufficient
dinner           may       house;         once
more proper   cheaper         your dinner before setting
    such   long journey.  , moreover,       fancy   making
  tour   Hellas       Peloponnese,     yoke   horses,  
  conduct   myself through   our principal cities. No    
send us away empty handed; every     give us something-   bronze
tripod,   couple   mules,     gold cup." 

"Menelaus," replied Telemachus, "  want     home   once,   when
  came away   left   property without protection,   fear   while
looking     father   shall come   ruin myself,   find   something
valuable has been stolen during   absence." 

When Menelaus heard     immediately told   wife   servants
  prepare   sufficient dinner       might       house.
    moment Eteoneus joined him,     lived close     had
just got  ;   Menelaus told him   light   fire   cook some
meat,       once did. Then Menelaus went down into   fragrant
store room,   alone, but Helen went too,   Megapenthes. When
  reached   place where   treasures     house were kept,  
selected   double cup,   told   son Megapenthes   bring also
  silver mixing bowl. Meanwhile Helen went     chest where she
kept   lovely dresses   she had made     own hands,  
took       was largest   most beautifully enriched   embroidery;
  glittered like   star,   lay     very bottom     chest.
Then     came back through   house again till   got   Telemachus,
  Menelaus said, "Telemachus, may Jove,   mighty husband   Juno,
bring   safely home according   your desire.     now present

made     present         course     visit     paid him while
  was     return home.   should like   give      ."

  these words   placed   double cup     hands   Telemachus,
while Megapenthes brought   beautiful mixing bowl   set   before
him. Hard   stood lovely Helen     robe ready     hand.

"  too,   son," said she, "  something         keepsake  
  hand   Helen;   is   your bride   wear upon   wedding day.
Till then,   your dear mother   keep      ; thus may    
back rejoicing   your own country     your home." 

  saying she gave   robe over   him     received   gladly.
Then Pisistratus put   presents into   chariot,   admired them
      did  . Presently Menelaus took Telemachus   Pisistratus
into   house,     both   them sat down   table.   maid servant
brought them water     beautiful golden ewer,   poured   into
  silver basin   them   wash   hands,   she drew   clean
table beside them;   upper servant brought them bread   offered
them many good things       was     house. Eteoneus carved
  meat   gave them each   portions, while Megapenthes poured
    wine. Then   laid   hands upon   good things  
were before them, but   soon     had had had enough   eat  
drink Telemachus   Pisistratus yoked   horses,   took  
places     chariot.   drove   through   inner gateway  
under   echoing gatehouse     outer court,   Menelaus came
after them     golden goblet   wine     right hand    
might make   drink offering before   set  .   stood   front
    horses   pledged them, saying, "Farewell   both    ;
see     tell Nestor how     treated  ,     was   kind
      any father could   while   Achaeans were fighting before
Troy." 

"      sure, sir," answered Telemachus, "  tell him everything
  soon     see him.   wish   were   certain   finding Ulysses
returned when     back   Ithaca,     might tell him     very
great kindness     shown         many beautiful presents
  am taking    ." 

    was thus speaking   bird flew     right hand-   eagle  
  great white goose   its talons     had carried off    
farm yard-       men   women were running after     shouting.
  came quite close     them   flew away     right hands
  front     horses. When   saw     were glad,    
hearts took comfort within them, whereon Pisistratus said, "Tell  ,
Menelaus, has heaven sent   omen   us      ?" 

Menelaus was thinking         most proper answer   him
  make, but Helen was too quick   him   said, "    read  
matter   heaven has put       heart,       doubt      
  come   pass.   eagle came     mountain where   was bred
  has its nest,     like manner Ulysses, after having travelled
far   suffered much,   return   take   revenge-   indeed
  is   back already   hatching mischief     suitors."

"May Jove   grant  ," replied Telemachus; "    should prove  
   ,     make vows       though   were   god, even when
  am   home." 

    spoke   lashed   horses     started off   full speed
through   town towards   open country.   swayed   yoke upon
  necks   travelled   whole day long till   sun set  
darkness was over     land. Then   reached Pherae, where Diocles
lived   was son   Ortilochus,   son   Alpheus.     passed
  night   were treated hospitably. When   child   morning,
rosy fingered Dawn, appeared,   again yoked   horses    
places     chariot.   drove   through   inner gateway  
under   echoing gatehouse     outer court. Then Pisistratus lashed
  horses       flew forward nothing loath; ere long   came
  Pylos,   then Telemachus said: 

"Pisistratus,   hope     promise         am going   ask
 .   know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover,  
are both     age,     journey has brought us together still
more closely;    , therefore, take   past   ship, but leave  
 ,           your father   house     try   keep    
  warmth     good   towards  ,     must   home   once."

Pisistratus thought how   should       was asked,       end
  deemed   best   turn   horses towards   ship,   put Menelaus  
beautiful presents   gold   raiment     stern     vessel.
Then   said, "    board   once   tell your men       also
before   can reach home   tell   father.   know how obstinate  
is,   am sure       let    ;     come down here  
fetch  ,           back without  . But       very
angry." 

      drove   goodly steeds back     city     Pylians
  soon reached   home, but Telemachus called   men together
  gave   orders. "Now,   men," said  , "  everything   order
  board   ship,   let us set   home." 

Thus did   speak,     went   board even     had said. But
  Telemachus was thus busied, praying also   sacrificing   Minerva
    ship   stern,   came   him   man     distant country,
  seer,   was flying   Argos because   had killed   man.  
was descended   Melampus,   used   live   Pylos,   land  
sheep;   was rich   owned   great house, but   was driven into
exile     great   powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized   goods
  held them     whole year, during     was   close prisoner
    house   king Phylacus,     much distress   mind both  
account     daughter   Neleus   because   was haunted    
great sorrow   dread Erinyes had laid upon him.     end, however,
  escaped     life, drove   cattle   Phylace   Pylos,
avenged   wrong   had been done him,   gave   daughter  
Neleus     brother. Then   left   country   went   Argos,
where   was ordained     should reign over much people.  
  married, established himself,   had two famous sons Antiphates
  Mantius. Antiphates became father   Oicleus,   Oicleus   Amphiaraus,
  was dearly loved both   Jove     Apollo, but   did   live
  old age,     was killed   Thebes   reason     woman   gifts.
  sons were Alcmaeon   Amphilochus. Mantius,   other son  
Melampus, was father   Polypheides   Cleitus. Aurora, throned  
gold, carried off Cleitus     beauty   sake,     might dwell
among   immortals, but Apollo made Polypheides   greatest seer
    whole world now   Amphiaraus was dead.   quarrelled  
  father   went   live   Hyperesia, where   remained   prophesied
    men. 

  son, Theoclymenus,   was   now came     Telemachus    
was making drink offerings   praying     ship. "Friend'" said
 , "now     find   sacrificing     place,   beseech  
  your sacrifices themselves,       god   whom   make them,
  pray   also   your own head     those   your followers, tell
    truth   nothing but   truth.     whence are  ? Tell
  also   your town   parents." 

Telemachus said, "    answer   quite truly.   am   Ithaca,
    father is 'Ulysses,   surely       ever lived. But  
has come   some miserable end. Therefore     taken   ship  
got   crew together   see     can hear any news   him,    
has been away   long time." 

"  too," answered Theoclymenus, am   exile,       killed   man
    own race.   has many brothers   kinsmen   Argos,    
  great power among   Argives.   am flying   escape death  
  hands,   am thus doomed       wanderer     face    
earth.   am your suppliant; take  , therefore,   board your ship
    may   kill  ,     know   are   pursuit."

"      refuse  ," replied Telemachus, "    wish   join
us. Come, therefore,     Ithaca     treat   hospitably according
       ." 

      received Theoclymenus' spear   laid   down     deck
    ship.   went   board   sat     stern, bidding Theoclymenus
sit beside him; then   men let     hawsers. Telemachus told them
  catch hold     ropes,     made   haste      .  
set   mast   its socket     cross plank, raised     made
  fast     forestays,     hoisted   white sails  
sheets   twisted ox hide. Minerva sent them   fair wind   blew
fresh   strong   take   ship     course   fast   possible.
Thus then   passed   Crouni   Chalcis. 

Presently   sun set   darkness was over     land.   vessel
made   quick pass sage   Pheae   thence     Elis, where   Epeans
rule. Telemachus then headed       flying islands, wondering
within himself whether   should escape death   should   taken prisoner.

Meanwhile Ulysses     swineherd were eating   supper    
hut,     men supped   them.   soon     had had   eat
  drink, Ulysses began trying   prove   swineherd   see whether
    continue   treat him kindly,   ask him   stay      
station   pack him off     city;     said: 

"Eumaeus,        ,   morrow   want     away   begin begging
    town,         no more trouble         your men.
Give   your advice therefore,   let       good guide    
      show     way.         round     city begging
    needs must,   see   any     give     drink     piece
  bread.   should like also         house   Ulysses   bring
news     husband   queen Penelope.   could then     among
  suitors   see           abundance     give  
  dinner.   should soon make them   excellent servant     sorts
  ways. Listen   believe when   tell         blessing  
Mercury   gives grace   good name     works     men,  
is no   living     make   more handy servant than   should-
  put fresh wood     fire, chop fuel, carve, cook, pour   wine,
      those services   poor men           betters."

  swineherd was very much disturbed when   heard  . "Heaven
help  ,"   exclaimed, "  ever can   put such   notion    
into your head?       near   suitors       undone    
certainty,     pride   insolence reach   very heavens.  
  never think   taking   man like       servant.   servants
are   young men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks   shirts,  
well looking faces     hair always tidy,   tables are kept
quite clean   are loaded   bread, meat,   wine. Stay where
  are, then;   are     anybody   way;       mind your being
here, no more   any     others,   when Telemachus comes home
    give     shirt   cloak     send   wherever  
want    ." 

Ulysses answered, "  hope   may     dear     gods     are
   ,   having saved     going     getting into trouble;
  is nothing worse than being always ways     tramp; still,
when men   once got low down     world       through
  great deal   behalf     miserable bellies. Since however  
press     stay here   await   return   Telemachus, tell  
Ulysses' mother,     father whom   left     threshold   old
age when   set     Troy. Are   still living   are   already
dead       house   Hades?" 

"    tell       them," replied Eumaeus, "Laertes is still
living   prays heaven   let him depart peacefully   own house,
    is terribly distressed     absence     son,   also
    death     wife,   grieved him greatly   aged him
more than anything else did. She came     unhappy end through sorrow
    son: may no friend   neighbour   has dealt kindly    
come   such   end   she did.   long   she was still living, though
she was always grieving,   used   like seeing     asking  
how she did,   she brought     along     daughter Ctimene,
  youngest     children;   were boy   girl together,   she
made little difference between us. When, however,   both grew  ,
  sent Ctimene   Same   received   splendid dowry    .  
   ,   mistress gave     good shirt   cloak     pair  
sandals     feet,   sent   off into   country, but she was
just   fond       ever.   is   over now. Still   has pleased
heaven   prosper   work     situation     now hold.    
enough   eat   drink,   can find something   any respectable
stranger   comes here; but   is no getting   kind word   deed
      mistress,     house has fallen into   hands   wicked
people. Servants want sometimes   see   mistress       talk
   ;   like     something   eat   drink     house,
  something too   take back   them into   country.   is
    keep servants     good humour." 

Ulysses answered, "Then   must   been   very little fellow, Eumaeus,
when   were taken   far away   your home   parents. Tell  ,
  tell   true, was   city     your father   mother lived
sacked   pillaged,   did some enemies carry   off when   were
alone tending sheep   cattle, ship   off here,   sell    
whatever your master gave them?" 

"Stranger," replied Eumaeus, "  regards your question: sit still,
make yourself comfortable, drink your wine,   listen    .  
nights are now     longest;   is plenty   time both  
sleeping   sitting   talking together;   ought         bed
till bed time, too much sleep is   bad   too little;   any  
    others wishes       bed let him leave us      ;   can
then take   master   pigs   when   has done breakfast     morning.
  two   sit here eating   drinking     hut,   telling  
another stories   our misfortunes;   when   man has suffered
much,   been buffeted       world,   takes pleasure   recalling
  memory   sorrows     long gone  .   regards your question,
then,   tale is   follows: 

"  may   heard     island called Syra   lies over above
Ortygia, where   land begins   turn round   look   another direction.
  is   very thickly peopled, but   soil is good,   much pasture
fit   cattle   sheep,     abounds   wine   wheat. Dearth
never comes  , nor are   people plagued   any sickness, but
when   grow old Apollo comes   Diana   kills them    
painless shafts.   contains two communities,     whole country
is divided between these two.   father Ctesius son   Ormenus,  
man comparable     gods, reigned over both. 

"Now     place   came some cunning traders   Phoenicia
(    Phoenicians are great mariners)     ship     had
freighted   gewgaws     kinds.   happened       Phoenician
woman     father   house, very tall   comely,     excellent
servant; these scoundrels got hold       day when she was washing
near   ship, seduced  ,   cajoled     ways   no woman
can resist, no matter how good she may     nature.   man   had
seduced   asked     she was   where she came  ,    
  she told him   father   name. '  come   Sidon,' said she,
'  am daughter   Arybas,   man rolling   wealth.   day    
was coming into   town     country some Taphian pirates seized
    took   here over   sea, where   sold       man  
owns   house,     gave them   price    .' 

"  man   had seduced   then said, '    like   come along
  us   see   house   your parents   your parents themselves?
  are both alive   are said     well off.' 

"'        gladly,' answered she, '    men   first swear
    solemn oath           no harm     way.'

"    swore   she told them,   when   had completed  
oath   woman said, 'Hush;     any   your men meets      
street       well,     let him speak    ,   fear some  
should     tell   master,     case     suspect something.
    put     prison,             murdered; keep
your own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise   fast     can,
  send   word when     done loading.     bring   much
gold     can lay   hands  ,     is something else also  
  can   towards paying   fare.   am nurse     son     good
man     house,   funny little fellow just able   run  .  
  carry him off   your ship,           great deal  
money   him     take him   sell him   foreign parts.'

"    she went back     house.   Phoenicians stayed   whole
year till   had loaded   ship   much precious merchandise,
  then, when   had got freight enough,   sent   tell  
woman.   messenger,   very cunning fellow, came     father  
house bringing   necklace   gold   amber beads strung among  ;
  while   mother     servants had       hands admiring
    bargaining    ,   made   sign quietly     woman  
then went back     ship, whereon she took       hand   led
        house.     fore part     house she saw   tables
set     cups   guests   had been feasting     father,
  being   attendance   him; these were now   gone     meeting
    public assembly,   she snatched   three cups   carried
them off     bosom     dress, while   followed  ,     knew
no better.   sun was now set,   darkness was over     land,
    hurried     fast     could till   reached   harbour,
where   Phoenician ship was lying. When   had got   board  
sailed   ways over   sea, taking us   them,   Jove sent
then   fair wind; six days did   sail both night   day, but  
  seventh day Diana struck   woman   she fell heavily down into
  ship   hold   though she were   sea gull alighting     water;
    threw   overboard     seals   fishes,     was left
  sorrowful   alone. Presently   winds   waves took   ship
  Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry     chattels    ,   thus
  was   ever   came   set eyes upon   country." 

Ulysses answered, "Eumaeus,     heard   story   your misfortunes
    most lively interest   pity, but Jove has given   good
  well   evil,     spite   everything       good master,
  sees     always   enough   eat   drink;     lead
  good life, whereas   am still going   begging   way   city
  city." 

Thus did   converse,     had only   very little time left
  sleep,     was soon daybreak.     meantime Telemachus  
  crew were nearing land,     loosed   sails, took down  
mast,   rowed   ship into   harbour.   cast     mooring
stones   made fast   hawsers;   then got   upon   sea shore,
mixed   wine,   got dinner ready.   soon     had had enough
  eat   drink Telemachus said, "Take   ship       town, but
leave   here,     want   look after   herdsmen        
farms.     evening, when     seen     want,     come down
    city,     morrow morning   return   your trouble    
give       good dinner   meat   wine." 

Then Theoclymenus said, '   ,   dear young friend, is   become
   ?   whose house, among   your chief men, am     repair?  
shall     straight   your own house     your mother?"

"  any other time," replied Telemachus, "  should   bidden  
      own house,       find no want   hospitality;  
  present moment, however,         comfortable  ,  
  shall   away,     mother     see  ; she does   often
show herself even     suitors, but sits     loom weaving  
  upper chamber,       way; but   can tell     man whose
house   can    -   mean Eurymachus   son   Polybus,   is
held     highest estimation   every     Ithaca.   is much
  best man     most persistent wooer,     those   are paying
court     mother   trying   take Ulysses' place. Jove, however,
  heaven alone knows whether   no     come     bad end before
  marriage takes place." 

    was speaking   bird flew   upon   right hand-   hawk, Apollo  
messenger.   held   dove   its talons,     feathers,     tore
them off, fell     ground midway between Telemachus     ship.
    Theoclymenus called him apart   caught him     hand.
"Telemachus," said  , "  bird did   fly   your right hand without
having been sent     some god.   soon     saw     knew  
was   omen;   means       remain powerful      
    no house   Ithaca more royal than your own." 

"  wish   may prove  ," answered Telemachus. "    does,    
show     much good     give     many presents    
  meet     congratulate  ." 

Then   said     friend Piraeus, "Piraeus, son   Clytius,  
  throughout shown yourself   most willing   serve      
those     accompanied     Pylos;   wish     take  
stranger   your own house   entertain him hospitably till   can
come   him." 

  Piraeus answered, "Telemachus,   may stay away   long    
please, but     look after him    ,     shall find no lack
  hospitality." 

    spoke   went   board,   bade   others     also   loose
  hawsers,     took   places     ship. But Telemachus
bound     sandals,   took   long   doughty spear     head
  sharpened bronze     deck     ship. Then   loosed  
hawsers, thrust   ship off   land,   made   towards   city
    had been told    , while Telemachus strode     fast  
  could, till   reached   homestead where   countless herds
  swine were feeding,   where dwelt   excellent swineherd,  
was   devoted   servant     master.

BOOK XVI

Meanwhile Ulysses     swineherd had lit   fire     hut  
were were getting breakfast ready   daybreak     had sent  
men       pigs. When Telemachus came  ,   dogs did   bark,
but fawned upon him,   Ulysses, hearing   sound   feet   noticing
    dogs did   bark, said   Eumaeus: 

"Eumaeus,   hear footsteps;   suppose     your men   some  
  your acquaintance is coming here,     dogs are fawning urn
him     barking." 

  words were hardly       mouth before   son stood    
door. Eumaeus sprang     feet,     bowls       was mixing
wine fell     hands,     made towards   master.   kissed
  head   both   beautiful eyes,   wept   joy.   father could
    more delighted     return     only son,   child    
old age, after ten years' absence     foreign country   after having
gone through much hardship.   embraced him, kissed him   over  
though   had come back     dead,   spoke fondly   him saying:

"    are come, Telemachus, light     eyes     are. When
  heard   had gone   Pylos   made sure   was never going   see
  any more. Come  ,   dear child,   sit down,     may  
  good look     now   are home again;   is   very often  
come into   country   see us herdsmen;   stick pretty close  
  town generally.   suppose   think   better   keep   eye  
    suitors are doing." 

"     , old friend," answered Telemachus, "but   am come now because
  want   see  ,     learn whether   mother is still    
old home   whether some   else has married  ,       bed
  Ulysses is without bedding   covered   cobwebs."

"She is still     house," replied Eumaeus, "grieving   breaking
  heart,   doing nothing but weep, both night   day continually."

  spoke   took Telemachus' spear, whereon   crossed   stone threshold
  came inside. Ulysses rose     seat   give him place    
entered, but Telemachus checked him; "Sit down, stranger." said  ,
"  can easily find another seat,     is   here     lay
     ." 

Ulysses went back     own place,   Eumaeus strewed some green
brushwood     floor   threw   sheepskin   top       Telemachus
  sit upon. Then   swineherd brought them platters   cold meat,
  remains       had eaten   day before,     filled
  bread baskets   bread   fast     could.   mixed wine also
  bowls   ivy wood,   took   seat facing Ulysses. Then  
laid   hands     good things   were before them,    
soon     had had enough   eat   drink Telemachus said   Eumaeus,
"Old friend, where does   stranger come  ? How did   crew
bring him   Ithaca,     were  ?-  assuredly   did   come
here   land"' 

      answered,   swineherd Eumaeus, "  son,     tell  
  real truth.   says   is   Cretan,       has been   great
traveller.     moment   is running away     Thesprotian ship,
  has refuge     station,       put him into your hands.  
whatever   like   him, only remember     is your suppliant."

"  am very much distressed," said Telemachus, "        just
told  . How can   take   stranger into   house?   am   yet young,
  am   strong enough   hold   own   any man attacks  .  
mother cannot make     mind whether   stay where she is   look
after   house     respect   public opinion     memory  
  husband,   whether   time is now come       take   best
man   those   are wooing  ,           make    
most advantageous offer; still,     stranger has come   your station
    find him   cloak   shirt   good wear,     sword   sandals,
    send him wherever   wants    .       like   can
keep him here     station,       send him clothes   food
    may   no burden         your men; but        
him   near   suitors,     are very insolent,   are sure
  ill treat him     way     greatly grieve  ; no matter
how valiant   man may     can   nothing against numbers,    
    too strong   him." 

Then Ulysses said, "Sir,   is right     should   something myself.
  am much shocked         said     insolent way
      suitors are behaving   despite   such   man    
are. Tell  ,     submit   such treatment tamely,   has some
god set your people against  ? May     complain   your brothers-
    is   these     man may look   support, however great
  quarrel may  ?   wish   were   young     are       present
mind;     were son   Ulysses,  , indeed, Ulysses himself,    
rather some   came   cut   head off, but           house
      bane   every     these men.     were too many  
 -   being single handed-     rather die fighting     own house
than see such disgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly
maltreated,   men dragging   women servants     house  
  unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly,   bread wasted     no
purpose     end   shall never   accomplished." 

  Telemachus answered, "    tell   truly everything.  
is no emnity between       people, nor can   complain   brothers,
  whom   man may look   support however great   quarrel may  .
Jove has made us   race   only sons. Laertes was   only son  
Arceisius,   Ulysses only son   Laertes.   am myself   only son
  Ulysses   left   behind him when   went away,        
never been   any use   him. Hence   comes     house is    
hands   numberless marauders;     chiefs       neighbouring
islands, Dulichium, Same, Zacynthus,   also     principal men
  Ithaca itself, are eating     house under   pretext   paying
court     mother,     neither   point blank   she  
  marry, nor yet bring matters     end,     are making havoc
    estate,   before long         myself into   bargain.
  issue, however, rests   heaven. But    , old friend Eumaeus,
    once   tell Penelope     am safe     returned  
Pylos. Tell     herself alone,   then come back here without letting
any   else know,     are many   are plotting mischief against
 ." 

"  understand   heed  ," replied Eumaeus; "  need instruct  
no further, only   am going   way   whether   had   better
let poor Laertes know     are returned.   used   superintend
  work     farm   spite     bitter sorrow   Ulysses,
      eat   drink     along     servants; but  
tell         day       set     Pylos   has neither
eaten nor drunk     ought    , nor does   look after   farm,
but sits weeping   wasting   flesh   off   bones."

"More     pity," answered Telemachus, "  am sorry   him, but  
must leave him   himself just now.   people could   everything
  own way,   first thing   should choose       return
    father; but  ,   give your message; then make haste back
again,       turn     your way   tell Laertes. Tell   mother
  send       women secretly     news   once,   let him
hear      ." 

Thus did   urge   swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took   sandals,
bound them     feet,   started     town. Minerva watched
him well off   station,   then came           form    
woman- fair, stately,   wise. She stood against   side    
entry,   revealed herself   Ulysses, but Telemachus could   see
 ,   knew     she was  ,     gods     let themselves
  seen   everybody. Ulysses saw  ,     did   dogs,    
did   bark, but went scared   whining off     other side  
  yards. She nodded   head   motioned   Ulysses     eyebrows;
whereon   left   hut   stood before   outside   main wall
    yards. Then she said   him: 

"Ulysses, noble son   Laertes,   is now time       tell your
son:     keep him     dark any longer, but lay your plans  
  destruction     suitors,   then make     town.    
    long   joining  ,     too am eager     fray."

  she spoke she touched him     golden wand. First she threw
  fair clean shirt   cloak     shoulders; then she made him
younger     more imposing presence; she gave him back   colour,
filled     cheeks,   let   beard become dark again. Then she
went away   Ulysses came back inside   hut.   son was astounded
when   saw him,   turned   eyes away   fear   might   looking
upon   god. 

"Stranger," said  , "how suddenly     changed      
were   moment   two ago.   are dressed differently   your colour
is     same. Are   some     other     gods   live  
heaven?    ,   propitious     till   can make   due sacrifice
  offerings   wrought gold.   mercy upon  ." 

  Ulysses said, "  am no god, why should   take      ?  
am your father,   whose account   grieve   suffer   much  
  hands   lawless men." 

    spoke   kissed   son,     tear fell     cheek    
  ground,     had restrained   tears till now. but Telemachus
could   yet believe     was   father,   said: 

"  are     father, but some god is flattering     vain hopes
    may grieve   more hereafter; no mortal man could   himself
contrive           been doing,   make yourself old   young
    moment   notice, unless   god were   him.   second ago  
were old       rags,   now   are like some god come down
  heaven." 

Ulysses answered, "Telemachus,   ought         immeasurably
astonished     being really here.   is no other Ulysses  
  come hereafter. Such     am,   is  ,   after long wandering
  much hardship   got home     twentieth year     own country.
    wonder   is   work     redoubtable goddess Minerva,
  does     whatever she  ,   she can     she pleases.
    moment she makes   like   beggar,     next   am   young
man   good clothes     back;   is   easy matter     gods
  live   heaven   make any man look either rich   poor."

    spoke   sat down,   Telemachus threw   arms     father
  wept.   were both   much moved     cried aloud like
eagles   vultures   crooked talons     been robbed    
half fledged young   peasants. Thus piteously did   weep,  
  sun     gone down upon   mourning   Telemachus had
  suddenly said, "    ship,   dear father, did your crew bring
    Ithaca?     nation did   declare themselves    -  
  cannot   come   land?" 

"    tell     truth,   son," replied Ulysses. "  was  
Phaeacians   brought   here.   are great sailors,   are  
  habit   giving escorts   any     reaches   coasts.  
took   over   sea while   was fast asleep,   landed     Ithaca,
after giving   many presents   bronze, gold,   raiment. These
things   heaven   mercy are lying concealed     cave,     am now
come here     suggestion   Minerva     may consult   killing
our enemies. First, therefore, give     list     suitors,  
  number,     may learn  ,   how many,   are.   can
then turn   matter over     mind,   see whether   two can fight
  whole body   them ourselves,   whether   must find others  
help us." 

    Telemachus answered, "Father,     always heard   your
renown both     field     council, but   task   talk  
is   very great  :   am awed     mere thought    ; two men
cannot stand against many   brave ones.   are   ten suitors
only, nor twice ten, but ten many times over;   shall learn  
number   once.   are fifty two chosen youths   Dulichium,
      six servants;   Same   are twenty four; twenty
young Achaeans   Zacynthus,   twelve   Ithaca itself,  
  them well born.       them   servant Medon,   bard,  
two men   can carve   table.     face such numbers    ,  
may   bitter cause   rue your coming,   your revenge. See whether
  cannot think   some         willing   come   help
us." 

"Listen    ," replied Ulysses, "  think whether Minerva    
father Jove may seem sufficient,   whether   am   try   find some
  else   well." 

"Those whom     named," answered Telemachus, "are   couple  
good allies,   though   dwell high   among   clouds    
power over both gods   men." 

"These two," continued Ulysses, "    keep long       fray,
when   suitors     join fight     house. Now, therefore, return
home early   morrow morning,       among   suitors   before.
Later     swineherd   bring       city disguised     miserable
old beggar.     see them ill treating  , steel your heart against
  sufferings; even though   drag   feet foremost       house,
  throw things    , look       nothing beyond gently trying
  make them behave more reasonably; but       listen    ,
    day     reckoning is   hand. Furthermore    ,  
lay   saying   your heart, when Minerva shall put       mind,
    nod   head    ,     seeing         must collect
    armour   is     house   hide       strong store

 ;         taken             way     smoke,
inasmuch     is no longer     was when Ulysses went away, but
has become soiled   begrimed   soot. Add     more particularly
    are afraid Jove may set them     quarrel over   wine,
      may   each other some harm   may disgrace both
banquet   wooing,     sight   arms sometimes tempts people
  use them. But leave   sword     spear apiece   yourself  
 ,     couple oxhide shields       can snatch them     any
moment; Jove   Minerva   then soon quiet these people.  
is also another matter;     are indeed   son     blood runs
  your veins, let no   know   Ulysses is within   house- neither
Laertes, nor yet   swineherd, nor any     servants, nor even
Penelope herself. Let       exploit   women alone,   let
us also make trial   some other     men servants,   see   is
  our side   whose hand is against us." 

"Father," replied Telemachus, "    come   know        ,
  when         find     can keep your counsel.      
think, however,   plan   propose   turn   well   either

  wasting your estate   impunity   without compunction. Prove
  women     means,   see   are disloyal     guiltless,
but   am     favour   going round   trying   men.   can attend
    later  ,     really   some sign   Jove      
support  ." 

Thus did   converse,   meanwhile   ship   had brought Telemachus
    crew   Pylos had reached   town   Ithaca. When  
had come inside   harbour   drew   ship       land;  
servants came   took   armour   them,     left    
presents     house   Clytius. Then   sent   servant   tell
Penelope   Telemachus had gone into   country, but had sent  
ship     town   prevent     being alarmed   made unhappy.
  servant   Eumaeus happened   meet when   were both    
same errand   going   tell Penelope. When   reached   House,
  servant stood     said     queen     presence    
waiting women, "Your son, Madam, is now returned   Pylos"; but
Eumaeus went close     Penelope,   said privately     son
had given bidden him tell  . When   had given   message   left
  house   its outbuildings   went back     pigs again.

  suitors were surprised   angry     had happened,    
went outside   great wall   ran round   outer court,   held
  council near   main entrance. Eurymachus, son   Polybus, was
  first   speak. 

"  friends," said  , "  voyage   Telemachus   is   very serious
matter;   had made sure       come   nothing. Now, however,
let us draw   ship into   water,       crew together   send
after   others   tell them   come back   fast     can."

  had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned     place  
saw   ship inside   harbour,     crew lowering   sails,
  putting     oars;     laughed,   said     others,
"  need   send them any message,     are here. Some god must
  told them,   else   saw   ship    ,   could   overtake
 . 

      rose   went     water side.   crew then drew  
ship   shore;   servants took   armour   them,    
went       body     place   assembly, but       let
any   old   young sit along   them,   Antinous, son   Eupeithes,
spoke first. 

"Good heavens," said  , "see how   gods   saved   man  
destruction.   kept   succession   scouts upon   headlands  
day long,   when   sun was down   never went   shore   sleep,
but waited     ship   night till morning     hope   capturing
  killing him; but some god has conveyed him home   spite   us.
Let us consider how   can make   end   him.   must   escape
us; our affair is never likely   come off while is alive,    
is very shrewd,   public feeling is   no means     our side.
  must make haste before   can call   Achaeans   assembly;  
  lose no time   doing  ,         furious   us,  
  tell     world how   plotted   kill him, but failed  
take him.   people     like   when   come   know  
 ;   must see       us no hurt, nor drive us   our own
country into exile. Let us try   lay hold   him either     farm
away     town,       road hither. Then   can divide    
property amongst us,   let   mother     man   marries  
    house.     does   please  ,     wish Telemachus
  live     hold   father   property, then   must   gather
here   eat     goods     way, but must make our offers  
Penelope each     own house,   she can marry   man    
give   most    ,   whose lot   is   win  ." 

    held   peace until Amphinomus rose   speak.   was  
son   Nisus,   was son   king Aretias,     was foremost among
    suitors     wheat growing   well grassed island  
Dulichium;   conversation, moreover, was more agreeable   Penelope
than     any     other     was   man   good natural disposition.
"  friends," said  , speaking   them plainly       honestly,
"  am     favour   killing Telemachus.   is   heinous thing  
kill     is   noble blood. Let us first take counsel     gods,
      oracles   Jove advise  ,     both help   kill him
myself,     urge everyone else      ; but     dissuade
us,         hold your hands." 

Thus did   speak,     words pleased them well,     rose forthwith
  went     house   Ulysses where   took   accustomed
seats. 

Then Penelope resolved   she   show herself     suitors.
She knew     plot against Telemachus,     servant Medon had
overheard   counsels   had told  ; she went down therefore
    court attended     maidens,   when she reached   suitors
she stood         bearing posts supporting   roof     cloister
holding   veil before   face,   rebuked Antinous saying:

"Antinous, insolent   wicked schemer,       are   best
speaker   counsellor   any man your own age   Ithaca, but  
are nothing     kind. Madman, why should   try   compass  
death   Telemachus,   take no heed   suppliants, whose witness
is Jove himself?   is   right       plot thus against  
another.       remember how your father fled     house  
fear     people,   were enraged against him   having gone  
some Taphian pirates   plundered   Thesprotians   were   peace
  us?   wanted   tear him   pieces   eat   everything  
had, but Ulysses stayed   hands although   were infuriated,
  now   devour   property without paying    ,   break  
heart     wooing   wife   trying   kill   son. Leave off
doing  ,   stop   others also." 

    Eurymachus son   Polybus answered, "Take heart, Queen Penelope
daughter   Icarius,       trouble yourself   these matters.
  man is   yet born, nor never    ,   shall lay hands upon
your son Telemachus, while   yet live   look upon   face    
earth.    -     shall surely  -     spear shall   reddened
    blood;   many   time has Ulysses taken       knees,
held wine       lips   drink,   put pieces   meat into   hands.
Therefore Telemachus is much   dearest friend    ,   has nothing
  fear     hands   us suitors.   course,   death comes  
him     gods,   cannot escape  ."   said     quiet  ,
but   reality   was plotting against Telemachus. 

Then Penelope went upstairs again   mourned   husband till Minerva
shed sleep over   eyes.     evening Eumaeus got back   Ulysses
    son,   had just sacrificed   young pig     year old  
were ready; helping   another     supper ready; Minerva therefore
came     Ulysses, turned him into   old man     stroke    
wand,   clad him     old clothes again,   fear     swineherd
might recognize him     keep   secret, but     tell Penelope.

Telemachus was   first   speak. "      got back, Eumaeus,"
said  . "  is   news     town?     suitors returned,
  are   still waiting over yonder,   take       way home?"

"  did   think   asking    ," replied Eumaeus, "when   was
    town.   thought     give   message   come back   soon
    could.   met   man sent   those   had gone       Pylos,
    was   first   tell   new your mother, but   can    
  saw     own eyes;   had just got       crest     hill
  Mercury above   town when   saw   ship coming into harbour  
  number   men    .   had many shields   spears,     thought
  was   suitors, but   cannot   sure." 

  hearing   Telemachus smiled     father, but     Eumaeus
could   see him. 

Then, when   had finished   work     meal was ready,  
ate  ,   every man had   full share       were satisfied.
  soon     had had enough   eat   drink,   laid down  
rest   enjoyed   boon   sleep.

BOOK XVII

When   child   morning, rosy fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus
bound     sandals   took   strong spear   suited   hands,
    wanted     into   city. "Old friend," said       swineherd,
"    now       town   show myself     mother,   she  
never leave off grieving till she has seen  .       unfortunate
stranger, take him     town   let him beg     any    
  give him   drink     piece   bread.     trouble enough
    own,   cannot   burdened   other people.     makes
him angry   much   worse   him, but   like         mean."

Then Ulysses said, "Sir,       want   stay here;   beggar can
always   better   town than country,   any     likes can give
him something.   am too old   care   remaining here     beck
  call     master. Therefore let   man         just told
him,   take       town   soon       had   warm     fire,
    day has got   little heat    .   clothes are wretchedly
thin,     frosty morning   shall   perished   cold,    
    city is some way off." 

    Telemachus strode off through   yards, brooding   revenge
upon   When   reached home   stood   spear against   bearing post
    cloister, crossed   stone floor     cloister itself,  
went inside. 

Nurse Euryclea saw him long before any   else did. She was putting
  fleeces       seats,   she burst   crying   she ran  
  him;     other maids came   too,   covered   head  
shoulders     kisses. Penelope came       room looking
like Diana   Venus,   wept   she flung   arms     son.
She kissed   forehead   both   beautiful eyes, "Light    
eyes," she cried   she spoke fondly   him, "    are come home
again;   made sure   was never going   see   any more.   think
  your having gone off   Pylos without saying anything    
  obtaining   consent. But come, tell       saw."

"    scold  , mother,' answered Telemachus, "nor vex  , seeing
    narrow escape     had, but wash your face, change your dress,
  upstairs   your maids,   promise full   sufficient hecatombs
      gods   Jove   only grant us our revenge upon   suitors.
  must now       place   assembly   invite   stranger   has
come back       Pylos.   sent him       crew,   told
Piraeus   take him home   look after him till   could come  
him myself." 

She heeded   son   words, washed   face, changed   dress,  
vowed full   sufficient hecatombs       gods      
only vouchsafe   revenge upon   suitors. 

Telemachus went through,      ,   cloisters spear   hand-
  alone,     two fleet dogs went   him. Minerva endowed him
    presence   such divine comeliness     marvelled   him
    went  ,     suitors gathered round him   fair words
    mouths   malice     hearts; but   avoided them,  
went   sit   Mentor, Antiphus,   Halitherses, old friends  
  father   house,     made him tell them     had happened
  him. Then Piraeus came     Theoclymenus, whom   had escorted
through   town     place   assembly, whereon Telemachus   once
joined them. Piraeus was first   speak: "Telemachus," said  , " 
wish     send some   your women     house   take awa  
presents Menelaus gave  ." 

"      know, Piraeus," answered Telemachus, "  may happen.
    suitors kill       own house   divide   property among
them,     rather   had   presents than   any   those people
should   hold   them.       other hand   manage   kill them,
  shall   much obliged       kindly bring     presents."

  these words   took Theoclymenus     own house. When  
got     laid   cloaks     benches   seats, went into
  baths,   washed themselves. When   maids had washed   anointed
them,   had given them cloaks   shirts,   took   seats
  table.   maid servant then brought them water     beautiful golden
ewer,   poured   into   silver basin   them   wash   hands;
  she drew   clean table beside them.   upper servant brought them
bread   offered them many good things       was     house.
Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining     couch         bearing posts
    cloister,   spinning. Then   laid   hands     good
things   were before them,     soon     had had enough  
eat   drink Penelope said: 

"Telemachus,   shall   upstairs   lie down     sad couch,  
      ceased   water     tears,     day Ulysses set
    Troy     sons   Atreus.   failed, however,   make
  clear     before   suitors came back     house, whether
  no   had been able   hear anything     return   your
father." 

"    tell   then truth," replied   son. "  went   Pylos  
saw Nestor,   took       house   treated     hospitably
  though   were   son     own   had just returned after   long
absence;   also did   sons; but   said   had   heard   word
  any human being   Ulysses, whether   was alive   dead.
  sent  , therefore,     chariot   horses   Menelaus.  
  saw Helen,   whose sake   many, both Argives   Trojans, were
  heaven   wisdom doomed   suffer. Menelaus asked       was
  had brought     Lacedaemon,     told him   whole truth,
whereon   said, ' , then, these cowards   usurp   brave man  
bed?   hind might   well lay   new born young     lair    
lion,   then   off   feed     forest     some grassy dell.
  lion, when   comes back     lair,   make short work  
  pair   them,       Ulysses   these suitors.   father
Jove, Minerva,   Apollo,   Ulysses is still   man     was
when   wrestled   Philomeleides   Lesbos,   threw him   heavily
      Greeks cheered him-     is still such,   were  
come near these suitors,         short shrift     sorry
wedding.   regards your question, however,       prevaricate
nor deceive  , but     old man     sea told  ,   much
    tell     full.   said   could see Ulysses     island
sorrowing bitterly     house     nymph Calypso,   was keeping
him prisoner,     could   reach   home,     had no ships
nor sailors   take him over   sea.'   was   Menelaus told
 ,   when   had heard   story   came away;   gods then gave
    fair wind   soon brought   safe home again." 

  these words   moved   heart   Penelope. Then Theoclymenus
said    : 

"Madam, wife   Ulysses, Telemachus does   understand these things;
listen therefore    ,     can divine them surely,     hide
nothing    . May Jove   king   heaven     witness,    
rites   hospitality,     hearth   Ulysses       now come,
  Ulysses himself is even now   Ithaca,  , either going  
  country   staying     place, is enquiring into   these evil
deeds   preparing   day   reckoning     suitors.   saw   omen
when   was     ship   meant  ,     told Telemachus  
 ." 

"May     even  ," answered Penelope; "  your words come true,
  shall   such gifts   such good            
see   shall congratulate  ." 

Thus did   converse. Meanwhile   suitors were throwing discs,
  aiming   spears     mark     levelled ground   front  
  house,   behaving       old insolence. But when  
was now time   dinner,     flock   sheep   goats had come
into   town       country round,     shepherds  
usual, then Medon,   was   favourite servant,     waited
upon them   table, said, "Now then,   young masters,     had
enough sport,   come inside     may   dinner ready. Dinner
is     bad thing,   dinner time." 

  left   sports     told them,   when   were within
  house,   laid   cloaks     benches   seats inside,
  then sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs,     heifer,    
them fat   well grown. Thus   made ready     meal.    
meantime Ulysses     swineherd were   starting     town,
    swineherd said, "Stranger,   suppose   still want    
  town   day,     master said   were    ;     own part
  should   liked     stay here     station hand, but   must
      master tells  ,       scold   later  ,     scolding
      master is   very serious thing. Let us then   off,  
  is now broad day;       night again directly   then  
  find   colder." 

"  know,   understand  ," replied Ulysses; "  need   no more.
Let us   going, but         stick ready cut, let      
  walk  ,         road is   very rough  ."

    spoke   threw   shabby old tattered wallet over   shoulders,
    cord       hung,   Eumaeus gave him   stick    
liking.   two then started, leaving   station   charge    
dogs   herdsmen   remained behind;   swineherd led   way  
  master followed after, looking like some broken down old tramp
    leaned upon   staff,     clothes were     rags. When
  had got over   rough steep ground   were nearing   city,
  reached   fountain       citizens drew   water.
  had been made   Ithacus, Neritus,   Polyctor.   was  
grove   water loving poplars planted     circle   round  ,  
  clear cold water came down         rock high  , while above
  fountain   was   altar     nymphs,       wayfarers
used   sacrifice. Here Melanthius son   Dolius overtook them  
  was driving down some goats,   best     flock,     suitors'
dinner,     were two shepherds   him. When   saw Eumaeus
  Ulysses   reviled them   outrageous   unseemly language,
  made Ulysses very angry. 

"     ," cried  , "    precious pair   are. See how heaven
brings birds     same feather     another. Where, pray, master
swineherd, are   taking   poor miserable object?     make
any   sick   see such   creature   table.   fellow like   never
won   prize   anything     life, but       rubbing  
shoulders against every man   door post,   begging,     swords
  cauldrons like   man, but only     few scraps   worth begging
 .       give him         hand     station,   might
    clean     folds,   bring   bit   sweet feed     kids,
    could fatten   thighs   much     pleased   whey; but
  has taken   bad ways           any kind   work;  
    nothing but beg victuals     town over,   feed   insatiable
belly.    , therefore     shall surely  -     goes near Ulysses'
house         head broken     stools     fling  
him, till   turn him  ." 

   ,     passed,   gave Ulysses   kick     hip     pure
wantonness, but Ulysses stood firm,   did   budge     path.
    moment   doubted whether   no   fly   Melanthius   kill
him     staff,   fling him     ground   beat   brains
 ;   resolved, however,   endure     keep himself   check,
but   swineherd looked straight   Melanthius   rebuked him, lifting
    hands   praying   heaven     did  . 

"Fountain nymphs,"   cried, "children   Jove,   ever Ulysses burned
  thigh bones covered   fat whether   lambs   kids, grant  
prayer   heaven may send him home.     soon put   end  
  swaggering threats     such men         insulting
people gadding   over   town while your flocks are going   ruin
through bad shepherding." 

Then Melanthius   goatherd answered, "  ill conditioned cur,  
are   talking  ? Some day   other     put     board ship
  take       foreign country, where   can sell     pocket
  money     fetch.   wish   were   sure   Apollo  
strike Telemachus dead   very day,       suitors   kill
him,     am   Ulysses   never come home again." 

      left them   come       leisure, while   went
quickly forward   soon reached   house     master. When  
got     went     took   seat among   suitors opposite
Eurymachus,   liked him better than any     others.   servants
brought him   portion   meat,     upper woman servant set bread
before him     might eat. Presently Ulysses     swineherd
came       house   stood    , amid   sound   music,   Phemius
was just beginning   sing     suitors. Then Ulysses took hold
    swineherd   hand,   said: 

"Eumaeus,   house   Ulysses is   very fine place. No matter how
far         find few like  .   building keeps following
  after another.   outer court has   wall   battlements  
round  ;   doors are double folding,     good workmanship;  
      hard matter   take     force   arms.   perceive, too,
    are many people banqueting within  ,     is   smell
  roast meat,     hear   sound   music,     gods   made
    along   feasting." 

Then Eumaeus said, "    perceived aright,   indeed   generally
 ; but let us think       our best course.       inside
first   join   suitors, leaving   here behind  ,      
wait here   let       first? But     wait long,   some  
may   loitering   outside,   throw something    . Consider
  matter   pray  ." 

  Ulysses answered, "  understand   heed.     first   leave
  here where   am.   am quite used   being beaten   having things
thrown    .     been   much buffeted     war     sea
    am case hardened,     too may       rest. But  
man cannot hide away   cravings     hungry belly;   is   enemy
  gives much trouble     men;   is because       ships
are fitted     sail   seas,     make war upon other people."

    were thus talking,   dog   had been lying asleep raised
  head   pricked     ears.   was Argos, whom Ulysses had
bred before setting     Troy, but   had never had any work  
  him.     old days   used     taken       young men when
  went hunting wild goats,   deer,   hares, but now    
master was gone   was lying neglected     heaps   mule   cow
dung   lay   front     stable doors till   men should come
  draw   away   manure   great close;     was full   fleas.
  soon     saw Ulysses standing  ,   dropped   ears  
wagged   tail, but   could     close       master. When
Ulysses saw   dog     other side     yard, dashed   tear  
  eyes without Eumaeus seeing  ,   said: 

"Eumaeus,     noble hound   is over yonder     manure heap:
  build is splendid; is     fine   fellow     looks,   is  
only     those dogs   come begging     table,   are kept
merely   show?" 

"  hound," answered Eumaeus, "belonged   him   has died    
far country.     were     was when Ulysses left   Troy,  
  soon show       could  .   was     wild beast  
  forest   could   away   him when   was once   its tracks.
But now   has fallen   evil times,     master is dead   gone,
    women take no care   him. Servants never     work when
  master   hand is no longer over them,   Jove takes half  
goodness       man when   makes   slave   him." 

    spoke   went inside   buildings     cloister where  
suitors were, but Argos died   soon     had recognized   master.

Telemachus saw Eumaeus long before any   else did,   beckoned
him   come   sit beside him;     looked     saw   seat
lying near where   carver sat serving     portions    
suitors;   picked    , brought     Telemachus   table,   sat
down opposite him. Then   servant brought him   portion,   gave
him bread     bread basket. 

Immediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like   poor miserable
old beggar, leaning     staff       clothes     rags.
  sat down upon   threshold   ash wood just inside   doors leading
    outer     inner court,   against   bearing post   cypress wood
    carpenter had skillfully planed,   had made   join truly
  rule   line. Telemachus took   whole loaf     bread basket,
    much meat     could hold     two hands,   said   Eumaeus,
"Take       stranger,   tell him       round     suitors,
  beg   them;   beggar must     shamefaced." 

  Eumaeus went     him   said, "Stranger, Telemachus sends  
 ,   says   are       round     suitors begging,  
beggars must     shamefaced." 

Ulysses answered, "May King Jove grant   happiness   Telemachus,
  fulfil   desire     heart." 

Then   both hands   took   Telemachus had sent him,   laid
      dirty old wallet     feet.   went   eating   while
  bard was singing,   had just finished   dinner     left
off.   suitors applauded   bard, whereon Minerva went     Ulysses
  prompted him   beg pieces   bread   each       suitors,
    might see   kind   people   were,   tell   good
    bad; but come   might she was   going   save   single
    them. Ulysses, therefore, went     round, going   left
  right,   stretched     hands   beg   though   were   real
beggar. Some   them pitied him,   were curious   him, asking
  another     was   where   came  ; whereon   goatherd
Melanthius said, "Suitors     noble mistress,   can tell   something
  him,       seen him before.   swineherd brought him here,
but   know nothing     man himself, nor where   comes  ."

    Antinous began   abuse   swineherd. "  precious idiot,"
  cried, "      brought   man   town  ?      
tramps   beggars enough already   pester us     sit   meat?
    think     small thing   such people gather here   waste
your master   property   must   needs bring   man   well?"

  Eumaeus answered, "Antinous, your birth is good but your words
evil.   was no doing   mine     came here.   is likely  
invite   stranger     foreign country, unless         those
  can   public service     seer,   healer   hurts,   carpenter,
    bard   can charm us     Such men are welcome     world
over, but no   is likely   ask   beggar     only worry him.
  are always harder   Ulysses' servants than any     other suitors
are,   above      , but       care   long   Telemachus
  Penelope are alive   here." 

But Telemachus said, "Hush,     answer him; Antinous has   bitterest
tongue       suitors,     makes   others worse."

Then turning   Antinous   said, "Antinous,   take   much care
    interests   though   were your son. Why should   want  
see   stranger turned       house? Heaven forbid; take' something
  give   him yourself;       grudge  ;   bid   take  . Never
mind   mother, nor any     other servants     house; but  
know              ,     are more fond   eating things
yourself than   giving them   other people." 

"      mean, Telemachus," replied Antinous, "    swaggering
talk?       suitors were   give him   much      ,    
  come here again   another three months." 

    spoke   drew   stool       rested   dainty feet  
under   table,   made   though     throw     Ulysses,
but   other suitors   gave him something,   filled   wallet
  bread   meat;   was  , therefore,     back     threshold
  eat     suitors had given him, but   first went     Antinous
  said: 

"Sir, give   something;   are  , surely,   poorest man here;
  seem       chief, foremost among them  ; therefore   should
    better giver,       tell far   wide   your bounty.
  too was   rich man once,   had   fine house     own;   those
days   gave   many   tramp such     now am, no matter     might
  nor     wanted.   had any number   servants,       other
things   people     live well   are accounted wealthy,
but   pleased Jove   take   away    .   sent       band
  roving robbers   Egypt;   was   long voyage     was undone
   .   stationed   bade ships     river Aegyptus,   bade  
men stay   them   keep guard over them, while sent   scouts  
reconnoitre   every point   vantage. 

"But   men disobeyed   orders, took     own devices,   ravaged
  land     Egyptians, killing   men,   taking   wives
  children captives.   alarm was soon carried     city,  
when   heard   war cry,   people came     daybreak till
  plain was filled   soldiers horse   foot,       gleam
  armour. Then Jove spread panic among   men,       no
longer face   enemy,     found themselves surrounded.   Egyptians
killed many   us,   took   rest alive     forced labour  
them;     myself,   gave       friend   met them,   take
  Cyprus, Dmetor   name, son   Iasus,   was   great man   Cyprus.
Thence   am come hither     state   great misery." 

Then Antinous said, "  god can   sent such   pestilence   plague
us during our dinner?    , into   open part     court,  
    give   Egypt   Cyprus over again   your insolence  
importunity;     begged       others,       given
  lavishly,       abundance round them,     is easy  
  free   other people   property when   is plenty    ."

    Ulysses began   move off,   said, "Your looks,   fine
sir, are better than your breeding;     were   your own house
      spare   poor man   much     pinch   salt,   though
  are   another man  ,   surrounded   abundance,   cannot
find         give him even   piece   bread." 

  made Antinous very angry,     scowled   him saying, " 
shall pay     before     clear     court."   these
words   threw   footstool   him,   hit him     right shoulder blade
near   top     back. Ulysses stood firm     rock     blow
did   even stagger him, but   shook   head   silence     brooded
    revenge. Then   went back     threshold   sat down  ,
laying   well filled wallet     feet. 

"Listen    ,"   cried, "  suitors   Queen Penelope,     may
speak even     am minded.   man knows neither ache nor pain    
gets hit while fighting     money,       sheep     cattle;
  even   Antinous has hit   while     service     miserable
belly,   is always getting people into trouble. Still,    
poor   gods   avenging deities    ,   pray them   Antinous
may come     bad end before   marriage." 

"Sit where   are,   eat your victuals   silence,     off elsewhere,"
shouted Antinous. "      more         dragged hand  
foot through   courts,     servants shall flay   alive."

  other suitors were much displeased    ,         young
men said, "Antinous,   did ill   striking   poor wretch    
tramp:       worse         should turn       some god-
    know   gods     disguised     sorts   ways   people
  foreign countries,   travel     world   see     amiss
    righteously." 

Thus said   suitors, but Antinous paid them no heed. Meanwhile Telemachus
was furious     blow   had been given     father,  
though no tear fell   him,   shook   head   silence   brooded
    revenge. 

Now when Penelope heard     beggar had been struck     banqueting cloister,
she said before   maids, "    Apollo     strike  ,
Antinous,"     waiting woman Eurynome answered, "  our prayers
were answered         suitors   ever again see   sun
rise." Then Penelope said, "Nurse,   hate every single     them,
    mean nothing but mischief, but   hate Antinous like   darkness
  death itself.   poor unfortunate tramp has come begging    
house   sheer want. Every   else has given him something   put
    wallet, but Antinous has hit him     right shoulder blade
    footstool." 

Thus did she talk     maids   she sat     own room,    
  meantime Ulysses was getting   dinner. Then she called    
swineherd   said, "Eumaeus,     tell   stranger   come here,
  want   see him   ask him some questions.   seems     travelled
much,     may   seen   heard something     unhappy husband."

      answered,   swineherd Eumaeus, "  these Achaeans, Madam,
  only keep quiet,       charmed     history    
adventures.   had him three days   three nights         hut,
  was   first place   reached after running away     ship,
    has   yet completed   story     misfortunes.     had
been   most heaven taught minstrel     whole world,   whose
lips   hearers hang entranced,   could     been more charmed
    sat     hut   listened   him.   says   is   old friendship
between   house       Ulysses,       comes   Crete
where   descendants   Minos live, after having been driven hither
  thither   every kind   misfortune;   also declares    
has heard   Ulysses   being alive   near   hand among   Thesprotians,
      is bringing great wealth home   him." 

"Call him here, then," said Penelope, "    too may hear   story.
      suitors, let them take   pleasure indoors      
   ,       nothing   fret  .   corn   wine
remain unwasted     houses   none but servants   consume
them, while   keep hanging   our house day after day sacrificing
our oxen, sheep,   fat goats     banquets,   never giving
  much     thought     quantity   wine   drink. No estate
can stand such recklessness,       now no Ulysses   protect
us.     were   come again,       son   soon    
revenge." 

  she spoke Telemachus sneezed   loudly     whole house resounded
   . Penelope laughed when she heard  ,   said   Eumaeus,
"    call   stranger; did     hear how   son sneezed just
    was speaking?   can only mean       suitors are going
    killed,           them shall escape. Furthermore  
 ,   lay   saying   your heart:     am satisfied     stranger
is speaking   truth   shall give him   shirt   cloak   good wear."

When Eumaeus heard     went straight   Ulysses   said, "Father
stranger,   mistress Penelope, mother   Telemachus, has sent  
 ; she is   great grief, but she wishes   hear anything   can
tell       husband,     she is satisfied     are speaking
  truth, she   give     shirt   cloak,   are   very
things     are most   want  .     bread,   can   enough
      fill your belly,   begging     town,   letting
those give    ." 

"    tell Penelope," answered Ulysses, "nothing but   is strictly
true.   know       husband,     been partner   him
  affliction, but   am afraid   passing. through   crowd   cruel
suitors,     pride   insolence reach heaven. Just now, moreover,
    was going     house without doing any harm,   man gave
    blow   hurt   very much, but neither Telemachus nor any  
else defended  . Tell Penelope, therefore,     patient   wait
till sundown. Let   give     seat close       fire,    
clothes are worn very thin-   know   are,       seen them
ever since   first asked     help  - she can then ask    
  return     husband." 

  swineherd went back when   heard  ,   Penelope said   she
saw him cross   threshold, "Why       bring him here, Eumaeus?
Is   afraid   some     ill treat him,   is   shy   coming
inside   house    ? Beggars should     shamefaced."

      answered,   swineherd Eumaeus, "  stranger is quite
reasonable.   is avoiding   suitors,   is only doing   any
  else    .   asks     wait till sundown,        
much better, madam,     should   him     yourself, when
  can hear him   talk   him      ." 

"  man is no fool," answered Penelope, "    very likely  
    says,     are no such abominable people     whole world
  these men are." 

When she had done speaking Eumaeus went back     suitors,    
had explained everything. Then   went     Telemachus   said  
  ear     none could overhear him, "  dear sir,     now
  back     pigs,   see after your property     own business.
    look     is going   here, but above     careful  
keep     danger,     are many   bear   ill  . May
Jove bring them     bad end before     us   mischief."

"Very well," replied Telemachus, "  home when     had your dinner,
      morning come here     victims   are   sacrifice
    day. Leave   rest   heaven    ." 

    Eumaeus took   seat again,   when   had finished  
dinner   left   courts     cloister     men   table,
  went back     pigs.       suitors,   presently began
  amuse themselves   singing   dancing,     was now getting
  towards evening.

BOOK XVIII

Now   came   certain common tramp   used     begging  
over   city   Ithaca,   was notorious     incorrigible glutton
  drunkard.   man had no strength nor stay   him, but   was
  great hulking fellow   look  ;   real name,       mother
gave him, was Arnaeus, but   young men     place called him Irus,
because   used   run errands   any       send him.  
soon     came   began   insult Ulysses,     try   drive him
      own house. 

"  off, old man,"   cried, "    doorway,     shall   dragged
  neck   heels.       see     are   giving    
wink,   wanting     turn       force, only       like
     ?     then,       yourself,     shall come   blows."

Ulysses frowned   him   said, "  friend,       no manner  
harm; people give     great deal, but   am   jealous.   is
room enough     doorway     pair   us,     need   grudge
  things   are   yours   give.   seem     just such another
tramp   myself, but perhaps   gods   give us better luck  
   .    , however, talk too much   fighting      
incense  ,   old though   am,   shall cover your mouth   chest
  blood.   shall   more peace   morrow      ,      
  come     house   Ulysses any more." 

Irus was very angry   answered, "  filthy glutton,   run  
trippingly like   old fish fag.       good mind   lay both hands
   ,   knock your teeth     your head like   many boar  
tusks.   ready, therefore,   let these people here stand    
look  .     never   able   fight     is   much younger
than yourself." 

Thus roundly did   rate   another     smooth pavement   front
    doorway,   when Antinous saw   was going     laughed
heartily   said     others, "  is   finest sport    
ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything like   into   house.
  stranger   Irus   quarreled   are going   fight, let us
set them           once." 

  suitors   came   laughing,   gathered round   two ragged
tramps. "Listen    ," said Antinous, "  are some goats' paunches
down     fire,       filled   blood   fat,   set
aside   supper;     is victorious   proves himself      
better man shall     pick     lot;   shall   free   our
table         allow any other beggar     house    ."

  others   agreed, but Ulysses,   throw them off   scent, said,
"Sirs,   old man like myself, worn     suffering, cannot hold
  own against   young  ; but   irrepressible belly urges    ,
though   know   can only end     getting   drubbing.   must swear,
however   none       give     foul blow   favour Irus  
secure him   victory." 

  swore     told them,   when   had completed   oath
Telemachus put     word   said, "Stranger,         mind  
settle     fellow,   need     afraid   any   here. Whoever
strikes         fight more than  .   am host,     other
chiefs, Antinous   Eurymachus, both   them men   understanding,
are     same mind     am." 

Every   assented,   Ulysses girded   old rags     loins,
thus baring   stalwart thighs,   broad chest   shoulders,  
  mighty arms; but Minerva came     him   made   limbs even
stronger still.   suitors were beyond measure astonished,    
  turn towards   neighbour saying, "  stranger has brought
such   thigh       old rags       soon   nothing left
  Irus." 

Irus began     very uneasy     heard them, but   servants girded
him   force,   brought him [into   open part     court]  
such   fright     limbs were       tremble. Antinous scolded
him   said, "  swaggering bully,   ought never     been
born         are afraid   such   old broken down creature
    tramp is.    , therefore-     shall surely  -    
beats     proves himself   better man,   shall pack   off
  board ship     mainland   send     king Echetus,   kills
every     comes near him.     cut off your nose   ears,
  draw   your entrails     dogs   eat." 

  frightened Irus still more, but   brought him into   middle
    court,     two men raised   hands   fight. Then Ulysses
considered whether   should let drive   hard   him     make  
end   him then    ,   whether   should give him   lighter
blow   should only knock him down;     end   deemed   best
  give   lighter blow   fear   Achaeans should begin   suspect
    was. Then   began   fight,   Irus hit Ulysses    
right shoulder; but Ulysses gave Irus   blow     neck under  
ear   broke     bones     skull,     blood came gushing
      mouth;   fell groaning     dust, gnashing   teeth
  kicking     ground, but   suitors threw     hands  
nearly died   laughter,   Ulysses caught hold   him     foot
  dragged him into   outer court   far     gate house.  
  propped him   against   wall   put   staff     hands.
"Sit here," said  , "  keep   dogs   pigs off;   are   pitiful
creature,       try   make yourself king     beggars any
more   shall fare still worse." 

Then   threw   dirty old wallet,   tattered   torn, over  
shoulder     cord       hung,   went back   sit down
upon   threshold; but   suitors went within   cloisters, laughing
  saluting him, "May Jove,       other gods," said  , 'grant
  whatever   want   having put   end     importunity  
  insatiable tramp.     take him over     mainland presently,
  king Echetus,   kills every     comes near him."

Ulysses hailed       good omen,   Antinous set   great goat  
paunch before him filled   blood   fat. Amphinomus took two loaves
      bread basket   brought them   him, pledging him    
did       golden goblet   wine. "Good luck    ,"   said, "father
stranger,   are very badly off   present, but   hope      
better times      ." 

    Ulysses answered, "Amphinomus,   seem       man   good
understanding,   indeed   may well  , seeing whose son   are.
    heard your father well spoken  ;   is Nisus   Dulichium,
  man both brave   wealthy.   tell     are   son,    
appear       considerable person; listen, therefore,   take heed
      am saying. Man is   vainest     creatures    
  being upon earth.   long   heaven vouchsafes him health  
strength,   thinks     shall come   no harm hereafter,   even
when   blessed gods bring sorrow upon him,   bears       needs
must,   makes   best    ;   God Almighty gives men   daily
minds day   day.   know      ,     was   rich man once,
  did much wrong     stubbornness     pride,       confidence
    father     brothers   support  ; therefore let   man
fear God     things always,   take   good   heaven may see
fit   send him without vainglory. Consider   infamy     these
suitors are doing; see how   are wasting   estate,   doing
dishonour     wife,       is certain   return some day,  
 , too,   long hence. Nay,       here soon; may heaven send
  home quietly first     may   meet   him     day  
  coming,   once   is here   suitors         part bloodlessly."

  these words   made   drink offering,   when   had drunk  
put   gold cup again into   hands   Amphinomus,   walked away
serious   bowing   head,     foreboded evil. But even    
did   escape destruction,   Minerva had doomed him fall    
hand   Telemachus.     took   seat again     place    
  had come. 

Then Minerva put   into   mind   Penelope   show herself    
suitors,   she might make them still more enamoured    ,  
win still further honour     son   husband.   she feigned
  mocking laugh   said, "Eurynome,     changed        
fancy   show myself     suitors although   detest them.   should
like also   give   son   hint     had better     anything
more       them.   speak fairly enough but   mean mischief."

"  dear child," answered Eurynome, "        said is true,
    tell your son    , but first wash yourself   anoint
your face.           your cheeks   covered   tears;
  is   right     should grieve   incessantly;   Telemachus,
whom   always prayed     might live   see     beard, is
already grown  ." 

"  know, Eurynome," replied Penelope, "    mean well, but  
  try   persuade     wash     anoint myself,   heaven robbed
        beauty     day   husband sailed; nevertheless, tell
Autonoe   Hippodamia     want them.   must       when
  am     cloister;   am   going among   men alone;    
    proper          ." 

      old woman went       room   bid   maids    
  mistress.     meantime Minerva bethought     another matter,
  sent Penelope off into   sweet slumber;   she lay down    
couch     limbs became heavy   sleep. Then   goddess shed
grace   beauty over         Achaeans might admire  .
She washed   face     ambrosial loveliness   Venus wears
when she goes dancing     Graces; she made   taller    
  more commanding figure, while       complexion   was whiter
than sawn ivory. When Minerva had done     she went away, whereon
  maids came       women   room   woke Penelope    
sound     talking. 

"    exquisitely delicious sleep     been having," said she,
  she passed   hands over   face, "  spite       misery.
  wish Diana   let   die   sweetly now     very moment,
    might no longer waste   despair     loss     dear husband,
  possessed every kind   good quality   was   most distinguished
man among   Achaeans." 

  these words she came down     upper room,   alone but
attended   two     maidens,   when she reached   suitors she
stood         bearing posts supporting   roof     cloister,
holding   veil before   face,       staid maid servant   either
side    .     beheld     suitors were   overpowered  
became   desperately enamoured    ,   each   prayed   might
win       own bed fellow. 

"Telemachus," said she, addressing   son, "  fear   are no longer
  discreet   well conducted     used    . When   were younger
  had   greater sense   propriety; now, however,     are grown
 , though   stranger   look       take       son  
  well     father   far   size   good looks  , your conduct
is   no means     should  .   is     disturbance  
has been going  ,   how came     allow   stranger       disgracefully
ill treated?       happened     had suffered serious injury
while   suppliant   our house? Surely       been very discreditable
   ." 

"  am   surprised,   dear mother,   your displeasure," replied
Telemachus, "  understand         know when things are  
    should  ,     could     when   was younger;   cannot,
however, behave   perfect propriety     times. First    
then another   these wicked people here keeps driving        
mind,       no     stand    . After  , however,   fight
between Irus     stranger did   turn       suitors meant
     ,     stranger got   best    .   wish Father Jove,
Minerva,   Apollo   break   neck   every     these wooers
  yours, some inside   house   some  ;     wish   might
      limp   Irus is over yonder     gate     outer court.
See how   nods   head like   drunken man;   has had such   thrashing
    cannot stand     feet nor   back     home, wherever
  may  ,   has no strength left   him." 

Thus did   converse. Eurymachus then came     said, "Queen Penelope,
daughter   Icarius,       Achaeans   Iasian Argos could see
      moment,       still more suitors   your house
  tomorrow morning,     are   most admirable woman     whole
world both   regards personal beauty   strength   understanding."

    Penelope replied, "Eurymachus, heaven robbed        
beauty whether   face   figure when   Argives set sail   Troy
    dear husband   them.     were   return   look after
  affairs,   should both   more respected   show   better presence
    world.     is,   am oppressed   care,       afflictions
  heaven has seen fit   heap upon  .   husband foresaw    ,
  when   was leaving home   took   right wrist     hand- 'Wife,
'  said, '  shall       us come safe home   Troy,    
Trojans fight well both   bow   spear.   are excellent also
  fighting   chariots,   nothing decides   issue     fight
sooner than  .   know  , therefore, whether heaven   send
  back    ,   whether   may   fall over     Troy.    
meantime     look after things here. Take care     father  
mother     present,   even more   during   absence, but when
  see our son growing   beard, then marry whom    ,   leave
  your present home.   is     said   now   is   coming
true.   night   come when   shall     yield myself     marriage
    detest,   Jove has taken       hope   happiness.
  further grief, moreover, cuts       very heart.   suitors
are   wooing   after   custom     country. When men are courting
  woman     think       good wife   them     is   noble
birth,   when   are each trying   win     himself,  
usually bring oxen   sheep   feast   friends     lady,  
  make   magnificent presents, instead   eating   other people  
property without paying    ." 

  was   she said,   Ulysses was glad when   heard   trying
    presents       suitors,   flattering them   fair
words     knew she did   mean. 

Then Antinous said, "Queen Penelope, daughter   Icarius, take  
many presents     please   any       give them    ;
  is   well   refuse   present; but           our business
nor stir   where   are, till     married   best man among
us whoever   may  ." 

  others applauded   Antinous had said,   each   sent  
servant   bring   present. Antinous   man returned     large
  lovely dress most exquisitely embroidered.   had twelve beautifully
made brooch pins   pure gold       fasten  . Eurymachus
immediately brought     magnificent chain   gold   amber beads
  gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas   two men returned   some
earrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants   glistened most
beautifully; while king Pisander son   Polyctor gave     necklace
    rarest workmanship,   every   else brought     beautiful
present   some kind. 

Then   queen went back     room upstairs,     maids brought
  presents after  . Meanwhile   suitors took   singing  
dancing,   stayed till evening came.   danced   sang till  
grew dark;   then brought   three braziers   give light,  
piled them     chopped firewood very   dry,     lit torches
  them,     maids held   turn   turn  . Then Ulysses
said: 

"Maids, servants   Ulysses   has   long been absent,      
queen inside   house; sit       amuse  ,   spin,   pick
wool.     hold   light     these people.   may stay till
morning, but shall   beat  ,     can stand   great deal."

  maids looked     another   laughed, while pretty Melantho
began   gibe   him contemptuously. She was daughter   Dolius, but
had been brought     Penelope,   used   give   toys   play
 ,   looked after   when she was   child; but   spite    
  she showed no consideration     sorrows     mistress,
  used   misconduct herself   Eurymachus,   whom she was
  love. 

"Poor wretch," said she, "are   gone clean     your mind?  
  sleep   some smithy,   place   public gossips, instead   chattering
here. Are     ashamed   opening your mouth before your betters-
  many   them too? Has   wine been getting into your head,  
    always babble     way?   seem     lost your wits
because   beat   tramp Irus; take care     better man than
  does   come   cudgel       head till   pack   bleeding
      house." 

"Vixen," replied Ulysses, scowling    , "        tell Telemachus
      been saying,           torn limb   limb."

  these words   scared   women,     went off into   body
    house.   trembled   aver,     thought      
    said. But Ulysses took   stand near   burning braziers,
holding   torches   looking     people- brooding   while  
things   should surely come   pass. 

But Minerva     let   suitors     moment cease   insolence,
  she wanted Ulysses   become even more bitter against them; she
therefore set Eurymachus son   Polybus     gibe   him,   made
  others laugh. "Listen    ," said  , "  suitors   Queen Penelope,
    may speak even     am minded.   is     nothing    
man has come     house   Ulysses;   believe   light has  
been coming     torches, but     own head-     hair
is   gone, every bit    ." 

Then turning   Ulysses   said, "Stranger,     work     servant,
    send       wolds   see     are well paid? Can  
build   stone fence,   plant trees?         fed     year
round,     find     shoes   clothing.      , then?
   ;       got into bad ways,       want   work;
  had rather fill your belly   going round   country begging."

"Eurymachus," answered Ulysses, "        were   work   against
  other   early summer when   days are     longest- give
    good scythe,   take another yourself,   let us see  
  fast   longer   mow   stronger,   dawn till dark when
  mowing grass is  .         plough against  , let us
each take   yoke   tawny oxen, well mated     great strength  
endurance: turn   into   four acre field,   see whether    
  can drive   straighter furrow.  , again, war were   break  
  day, give     shield,   couple   spears     helmet fitting
well upon   temples-     find   foremost     fray,  
  cease your gibes     belly.   are insolent   cruel,
  think yourself   great man because   live     little world,
ind     bad  .   Ulysses comes     own again,   doors  
  house are wide, but     find them narrow when   try  
fly through them." 

Eurymachus was furious      .   scowled   him   cried, " 
wretch,     soon pay       daring     such things    ,
    public too. Has   wine been getting into your head    
  always babble     way?   seem     lost your wits because
  beat   tramp Irus.       caught hold     footstool,
but Ulysses sought protection     knees   Amphinomus   Dulichium,
    was afraid.   stool hit   cupbearer     right hand  
knocked him down:   man fell     cry flat     back,    
wine jug fell ringing     ground.   suitors     covered cloister
were now     uproar,       turn towards   neighbour, saying,
"  wish   stranger had gone somewhere else, bad luck   hide,  
    trouble   gives us.   cannot permit such disturbance  
  beggar;   such ill counsels are   prevail   shall   no more
pleasure   our banquet." 

    Telemachus came forward   said, "Sirs, are   mad? Can
    carry your meat   your liquor decently? Some evil spirit
has possessed  .       wish   drive any     away, but  
  had your suppers,     sooner       home   bed   better."

  suitors bit   lips   marvelled     boldness     speech;
but Amphinomus   son   Nisus,   was son   Aretias, said, " 
  let us take offence;   is reasonable,   let us make no answer.
Neither let us   violence     stranger nor   any   Ulysses'
servants. Let   cupbearer   round     drink offerings,  
  may make them     home   our rest.       stranger, let
us leave Telemachus   deal   him,     is     house  
  has come." 

Thus did   speak,     saying pleased them well,   Mulius  
Dulichium, servant   Amphinomus, mixed them   bowl   wine   water
  handed   round   each   them man   man, whereon   made
  drink offerings     blessed gods: Then, when   had made
  drink offerings   had drunk each       was minded,

BOOK XIX

Ulysses was left     cloister, pondering     means whereby
  Minerva   help   might   able   kill   suitors. Presently
  said   Telemachus, "Telemachus,   must     armour together
  take   down inside. Make some excuse when   suitors ask  
why     removed  .         taken            
way     smoke, inasmuch     is no longer     was when Ulysses
went away, but has become soiled   begrimed   soot. Add    
more particularly     are afraid Jove may set them     quarrel
over   wine,       may   each other some harm   may
disgrace both banquet   wooing,     sight   arms sometimes
tempts people   use them." 

Telemachus approved       father had said,     called nurse
Euryclea   said, "Nurse, shut   women       room, while
  take   armour     father left behind him down into   store
room. No   looks after   now   father is gone,     has got
  smirched   soot during   own boyhood.   want   take   down
where   smoke cannot reach  ." 

"  wish, child," answered Euryclea, "      take   management
    house into your own hands altogether,   look after    
property yourself. But   is           light      
store room?   maids      , but       let them.

"  stranger," said Telemachus, "shall show     light; when people
eat   bread   must earn  , no matter where   come  ."

Euryclea did   she was told,   bolted   women inside   room.
Then Ulysses     son made   haste   take   helmets, shields,
  spears inside;   Minerva went before them     gold lamp  
  hand   shed   soft   brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus
said, "Father,   eyes behold   great marvel:   walls,    
rafters, crossbeams,     supports       rest are   aglow
      flaming fire. Surely   is some god here   has come
down   heaven." 

"Hush," answered Ulysses, "hold your peace   ask no questions,  
  is   manner     gods.       your bed,   leave  
here   talk   your mother     maids. Your mother     grief
  ask     sorts   questions." 

    Telemachus went   torch light     other side     inner
court,     room       always slept.     lay     bed
till morning, while Ulysses was left     cloister pondering  
  means whereby   Minerva   help   might   able   kill  
suitors. 

Then Penelope came down     room looking like Venus   Diana,
    set     seat inlaid   scrolls   silver   ivory near
  fire     accustomed place.   had been made   Icmalius  
had   footstool       piece     seat itself;     was
covered     thick fleece:     she now sat,     maids came
    women   room   join  .   set   removing   tables
      wicked suitors had been dining,   took away   bread
  was left,     cups       had drunk.   emptied
  embers       braziers,   heaped much wood upon them  
give both light   heat; but Melantho began   rail   Ulysses  
second time   said, "Stranger,     mean   plague us   hanging
    house   night   spying upon   women?   off,   wretch,
outside,   eat your supper  ,     shall   driven    
  firebrand." 

Ulysses scowled       answered, "  good woman, why should  
    angry    ? Is   because   am   clean,     clothes
are     rags,   because   am obliged     begging   after
  manner   tramps   beggars generall?   too was   rich man once,
  had   fine house     own;   those days   gave   many   tramp
such     now am, no matter     might   nor     wanted.  
had any number   servants,       other things   people
    live well   are accounted wealthy, but   pleased Jove
  take   away    ; therefore, woman, beware lest   too come
  lose   pride   place       now wanton above your fellows;
    care lest         favour   your mistress,   lest
Ulysses should come home,     is still   chance     may
   . Moreover, though     dead     think   is, yet   Apollo  
    has left   son behind him, Telemachus,     note anything
done amiss     maids     house,     is now no longer    
boyhood." 

Penelope heard     was saying   scolded   maid, "Impudent
baggage, said she, "  see how abominably   are behaving,    
shall smart    .   knew perfectly well,     told   myself,
    was going   see   stranger   ask him     husband,
  whose sake   am   such continual sorrow." 

Then she said     head waiting woman Eurynome, "Bring   seat  
  fleece upon  ,     stranger   sit upon while   tells  
story,   listens            .   wish   ask him some questions."

Eurynome brought   seat   once   set   fleece upon  ,    
soon   Ulysses had sat down Penelope began   saying, "Stranger,
  shall first ask       whence are  ? Tell     your town
  parents." 

"Madam;" answered Ulysses, "      face     whole earth can
dare   chide    ? Your fame reaches   firmament   heaven
itself;   are like some blameless king,   upholds righteousness,
    monarch over   great   valiant nation:   earth yields its
wheat   barley,   trees are loaded   fruit,   ewes bring
forth lambs,     sea abounds   fish   reason     virtues,
    people   good deeds under him. Nevertheless,     sit here
  your house, ask   some other question       seek   know
  race   family,       recall memories     yet more
increase   sorrow.   am full   heaviness, but   ought     sit
weeping   wailing   another person   house, nor is   well    
thus grieving continually.   shall         servants   even
yourself complaining    ,   saying     eyes swim   tears
because   am heavy   wine." 

Then Penelope answered, "Stranger, heaven robbed       beauty,
whether   face   figure, when   Argives set sail   Troy  
  dear husband   them.     were   return   look after  
affairs   should   both more respected   should show   better presence
    world.     is,   am oppressed   care,       afflictions
  heaven has seen fit   heap upon  .   chiefs     our
islands- Dulichium, Same,   Zacynthus,   also   Ithaca itself,
are wooing   against       are wasting   estate.   can therefore
show no attention   strangers, nor suppliants, nor   people  
      are skilled artisans, but am     time brokenhearted
  Ulysses.   want     marry again   once,        
invent stratagems   order   deceive them.     first place heaven
put       mind   set     great tambour frame     room,  
  begin working upon   enormous piece   fine needlework. Then  
said   them, 'Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead, still,    
press     marry again immediately; wait-            
skill   needlework perish unrecorded- till     finished making
  pall     hero Laertes,     ready against   time when death
shall take him.   is very rich,     women     place   talk
    is laid   without   pall.'   was     said,    
assented; whereon   used   keep working     great web   day long,
but   night     unpick   stitches again   torch light.   fooled
them     way   three years without   finding    , but
  time wore       was now     fourth year,     waning  
moons,   many days had been accomplished, those good   nothing
hussies   maids betrayed       suitors,   broke   upon  
  caught  ;   were very angry    ,     was forced   finish
  work whether       no.   now       see how   can find
any further shift   getting       marriage.   parents are
putting great pressure upon  ,     son chafes     ravages  
suitors are making upon   estate,     is now old enough   understand
        is perfectly able   look after   own affairs,
  heaven has blessed him     excellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding
   , tell       are   where   come  -     must
  had father   mother   some sort;   cannot     son  
  oak       rock." 

Then Ulysses answered, "madam, wife   Ulysses, since   persist
  asking       family,     answer, no matter     costs
 : people must expect     pained when     been exiles  
long      ,   suffered   much among   many peoples. Nevertheless,
  regards your question     tell       ask.   is   fair
  fruitful island   mid ocean called Crete;   is thickly peopled
    are nine cities    :   people speak many different languages
  overlap   another,     are Achaeans, brave Eteocretans,
Dorians   three fold race,   noble Pelasgi.   is   great town
 , Cnossus, where Minos reigned   every nine years had   conference
  Jove himself. Minos was father   Deucalion, whose son   am,
  Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus   myself. Idomeneus sailed
  Troy,    ,   am   younger, am called Aethon;   brother,
however, was   once   older     more valiant     two; hence
  was   Crete     saw Ulysses   showed him hospitality,  
  winds took him       was     way   Troy, carrying him
      course   cape Malea   leaving him   Amnisus off  
cave   Ilithuia, where   harbours are difficult   enter    
could hardly find shelter     winds   were then xaging.  
soon     got     went into   town   asked   Idomeneus,
claiming       old   valued friend, but Idomeneus had already
set sail   Troy some ten   twelve days earlier,     took him  
  own house   showed him every kind   hospitality,     had abundance
  everything. Moreover,   fed   men   were   him   barley
meal     public store,   got subscriptions   wine   oxen
  them   sacrifice     heart   content.   stayed    
twelve days,     was   gale blowing     North   strong
    could hardly keep     feet   land.   suppose some unfriendly
god had raised     them, but     thirteenth day   wind dropped,
    got away." 

Many   plausible tale did Ulysses further tell  ,   Penelope wept
  she listened,     heart was melted.     snow wastes upon
  mountain tops when   winds   South East   West   breathed
upon     thawed   till   rivers run bank full   water, even
  did   cheeks overflow   tears     husband   was  
  time sitting     side. Ulysses felt       was    ,
but   kept   eyes   hard     iron without letting them   much
  quiver,   cunningly did   restrain   tears. Then, when she
had relieved herself   weeping, she turned   him again   said:
"Now, stranger,   shall put       test   see whether   no
  really did entertain   husband     men,         did.
Tell  , then, how   was dressed,   kind     man   was   look
 ,     also     companions." 

"Madam," answered Ulysses, "  is such   long time ago     can
hardly  . Twenty years are come   gone since   left   home,
  went elsewhither; but     tell     well     can recollect.
Ulysses wore   mantle   purple wool, double lined,     was fastened
    gold brooch   two catches     pin.     face    
  was   device   showed   dog holding   spotted fawn between
  fore paws,   watching       lay panting upon   ground.
Every   marvelled     way     these things had been done
  gold,   dog looking     fawn,   strangling  , while  
fawn was struggling convulsively   escape.       shirt  
  wore next   skin,   was   soft     fitted him like  
skin     onion,   glistened     sunlight     admiration
      women   beheld  . Furthermore    ,   lay   saying
  your heart,         know whether Ulysses wore these clothes
when   left home,   whether       companions had given them
  him while   was     voyage;   possibly some     whose house
  was staying made him   present   them,     was   man   many
friends   had few equals among   Achaeans.   myself gave him  
sword   bronze     beautiful purple mantle, double lined,  
  shirt   went down     feet,     sent him   board   ship
  every mark   honour.   had   servant   him,   little older
than himself,     can tell       was like;   shoulders were
hunched,   was dark,     had thick curly hair.   name was Eurybates,
  Ulysses treated him   greater familiarity than   did any  
  others,   being   most like minded   himself."

Penelope was moved still more deeply   she heard   indisputable
proofs   Ulysses laid before  ;   when she had again found
relief   tears she said   him, "Stranger,   was already disposed
  pity  , but henceforth   shall   honoured   made welcome
    house.   was     gave Ulysses   clothes   speak  .  
took them       store room   folded them   myself,     gave
him also   gold brooch   wear     ornament. Alas!   shall never
welcome him home again.   was     ill fate     ever set  
    detested city whose very name   cannot bring myself even
  mention." 

Then Ulysses answered, "Madam, wife   Ulysses,     disfigure yourself
further   grieving thus bitterly   your loss, though   can hardly
blame     doing  .   woman   has loved   husband   borne
him children,   naturally   grieved   losing him, even though
  were   worse man than Ulysses,       was like   god. Still,
cease your tears   listen       can tell     hide nothing
   ,   can     perfect truth       lately heard
  Ulysses   being alive       way home;   is among   Thesprotians,
  is bringing back much valuable treasure     has begged  
    another   them; but   ship       crew were lost  
  were leaving   Thrinacian island,   Jove     sun god
were angry   him because   men had slaughtered   sun god  
cattle,     were   drowned     man. But Ulysses stuck    
keel     ship   was drifted       land     Phaecians,
  are near   kin     immortals,     treated him   though
  had been   god, giving him many presents,   wishing   escort
him home safe   sound.   fact Ulysses     been here long
ago, had     thought better       land   land gathering wealth;
    is no man living   is   wily     is;   is no  
can compare   him. Pheidon king     Thesprotians told    
 ,     swore    - making drink offerings     house    
did  -     ship was     water side     crew found  
  take Ulysses     own country.   sent   off first,    
happened       Thesprotian ship sailing     wheat growing island
  Dulichium, but   showed     treasure Ulysses had got together,
    had enough lying     house   king Pheidon   keep   family
  ten generations; but   king said Ulysses had gone   Dodona
    might learn Jove   mind     high oak tree,   know whether
after   long   absence   should return   Ithaca openly     secret.
    may know   is safe       here shortly;   is close  
hand   cannot remain away   home much longer; nevertheless  
  confirm   words     oath,   call Jove   is   first

  pass. Ulysses   return     self same year;     end
    moon     beginning     next       here."

"May     even  ," answered Penelope; "  your words come true  
shall   such gifts   such good             see
  shall congratulate  ; but   know very well how      . Ulysses
    return, neither       your escort hence,     surely
    Ulysses ever was,   are now no longer any such masters
    house     was,   receive honourable strangers     further
them     way home.   now,   maids, wash   feet   him,
  make him   bed     couch   rugs   blankets,     may
  warm   quiet till morning. Then,   day break wash him   anoint
him again,     may sit     cloister   take   meals  
Telemachus.   shall     worse   any     these hateful people
  is uncivil   him; like      ,   shall   no more    
    house.   how, sir, shall     able   learn whether  
no   am superior   others     sex both   goodness   heart  
understanding,     let   dine     cloisters squalid   ill clad?
Men live but     little season;     are hard,   deal hardly,
people wish them ill   long     are alive,   speak contemptuously
  them when   are dead, but     is righteous   deals righteously,
  people tell     praise among   lands,   many shall call
him blessed." 

Ulysses answered, "Madam,     foresworn rugs   blankets  
  day     left   snowy ranges   Crete       shipboard.
    lie       lain   many   sleepless night hitherto. Night
after night     passed   any rough sleeping place,   waited
  morning. Nor, again,     like having   feet washed;   shall
  let any     young hussies   your house touch   feet; but,
      any old   respectable woman   has gone through  
much trouble      ,     allow     wash them." 

    Penelope said, "  dear sir,       guests   ever yet
came     house   never was     spoke     things  
such admirable propriety      .   happens         house
  most respectable old woman-   same   received   poor dear husband
    arms   night   was born,   nursed him   infancy. She
is very feeble now, but she shall wash your feet." "Come here," said
she, "Euryclea,   wash your master   age mate;   suppose Ulysses'
hands   feet are very much   same now     are,   trouble
ages     us dreadfully fast." 

  these words   old woman covered   face     hands; she
began   weep   made lamentation saying, "  dear child,   cannot
think whatever   am        .   am certain no   was ever more
god fearing than yourself,   yet Jove hates  . No       whole
world ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs
when   prayed   might come     green old age yourself   see
your son grow     take after  ; yet see how   has prevented  
alone   ever getting back   your own home.     no doubt  
women   some foreign palace   Ulysses has got   are gibing  
him     these sluts here   been gibing  .       wonder
  your   choosing   let them wash   after   manner    
    insulted  ;     wash your feet myself gladly enough,
  Penelope has said     am      ;     wash them both  
Penelope   sake     your own,       raised   most lively
feelings   compassion     mind;   let       moreover,  
pray attend  ;     had   kinds   strangers   distress come
here before now, but   make bold       no   ever yet came
  was   like Ulysses   figure, voice,   feet     are."

"Those     seen us both," answered Ulysses, "  always said
  were wonderfully like each other,   now     noticed   too.

Then   old woman took   cauldron     she was going   wash
  feet,   poured plenty   cold water into  , adding hot till
  bath was warm enough. Ulysses sat     fire, but ere long  
turned away     light,     occurred   him   when   old
woman had hold     leg she   recognize   certain scar  
  bore, whereon   whole truth   come  .   indeed   soon
  she began washing   master, she   once knew   scar    
  had been given him     wild boar when   was hunting   Mount
Parnassus     excellent grandfather Autolycus-   was   most
accomplished thief   perjurer     whole world-       sons
  Autolycus. Mercury himself had endowed him     gift,  
  used   burn   thigh bones   goats   kids   him,     took
pleasure     companionship.   happened once   Autolycus had
gone   Ithaca   had found   child     daughter just born.
  soon     had done supper Euryclea set   infant upon   knees
  said,   must find   name   your grandson;   greatly wished
    might    ." 

'Son   law   daughter," replied Autolycus, "call   child thus:
  am highly displeased     large number   people     place
  another, both men   women;   name   child 'Ulysses,'    
child   anger. When   grows     comes   visit   mother   family
  Mount Parnassus, where   possessions lie,     make him   present
    send him     way rejoicing." 

Ulysses, therefore, went   Parnassus       presents   Autolycus,
      sons shook hands   him   gave him welcome.   grandmother
Amphithea threw   arms   him,   kissed   head,   both
  beautiful eyes, while Autolycus desired   sons     dinner
ready,     did     told them.   brought     five year old
bull, flayed  , made   ready   divided   into joints; these  
then cut carefully   into smaller pieces   spitted them;   roasted
them sufficiently   served   portions round. Thus through  
livelong day     going down     sun   feasted,   every
man had   full share       were satisfied; but when   sun
set     came   dark,   went   bed   enjoyed   boon  
sleep. 

When   child   morning, rosy fingered Dawn, appeared,   sons
  Autolycus went       hounds hunting,   Ulysses went
too.   climbed   wooded slopes   Parnassus   soon reached
its breezy upland valleys; but     sun was beginning   beat upon
  fields, fresh risen     slow still currents   Oceanus,  
came     mountain dell.   dogs were   front searching    
tracks     beast   were chasing,   after them came   sons
  Autolycus, among whom was Ulysses, close behind   dogs,    
had   long spear     hand. Here was   lair     huge boar among
some thick brushwood,   dense     wind   rain could    
through  , nor could   sun   rays pierce  ,     ground underneath
lay thick   fallen leaves.   boar heard   noise     men  
feet,     hounds baying   every side     huntsmen came  
  him,   rushed     lair, raised   bristles     neck,
  stood   bay   fire flashing     eyes. Ulysses was  
first   raise   spear   try   drive   into   brute, but  
boar was too quick   him,   charged him sideways, ripping him
above   knee     gash   tore deep though   did   reach
  bone.       boar, Ulysses hit him     right shoulder,
    point     spear went right through him,       fell
groaning     dust until   life went     him.   sons   Autolycus
busied themselves     carcass     boar,   bound Ulysses'
wound; then, after saying   spell   stop   bleeding,   went
home   fast     could. But when Autolycus     sons had thoroughly
healed Ulysses,   made him some splendid presents,   sent him
back   Ithaca   much mutual good  . When   got back,   father
  mother were rejoiced   see him,   asked him      ,  
how   had hurt himself       scar;     told them how   boar
had ripped him when   was   hunting   Autolycus     sons
  Mount Parnassus. 

  soon   Euryclea had got   scarred limb     hands   had
well hold    , she recognized     dropped   foot   once.  
leg fell into   bath,   rang     was overturned,    
    water was spilt     ground; Euryclea   eyes between  
joy     grief filled   tears,   she could   speak, but
she caught Ulysses     beard   said, "  dear child,   am sure
  must   Ulysses himself, only   did   know   till   had actually
touched   handled  ." 

  she spoke she looked towards Penelope,   though wanting   tell
      dear husband was     house, but Penelope was unable
  look     direction   observe   was going  ,   Minerva
had diverted   attention;   Ulysses caught Euryclea     throat
    right hand       left drew   close   him,   said,
"Nurse,     wish       ruin    ,     nursed     your
own breast, now   after twenty years   wandering   am   last
come     own home again? Since   has been borne   upon    
heaven   recognize  , hold your tongue,           word  
  any   else     house,           tell  -     shall
surely  -     heaven grants     take   lives   these suitors,
      spare  , though   are   own nurse, when   am killing
  other women." 

"  child," answered Euryclea, "  are   talking  ?   know
very well   nothing can either bend   break  .     hold  
tongue like   stone     piece   iron; furthermore let    ,  
lay   saying   your heart, when heaven has delivered   suitors
into your hand,     give     list     women     house  
  been ill behaved,     those   are guiltless." 

  Ulysses answered, "Nurse,   ought     speak     way;
  am well able   form   own opinion           them; hold
your tongue   leave everything   heaven." 

    said   Euryclea left   cloister   fetch some more water,
    first had been   spilt;   when she had washed him  
anointed him   oil, Ulysses drew   seat nearer     fire  
warm himself,   hid   scar under   rags. Then Penelope began
talking   him   said: 

"Stranger,   should like   speak     briefly   another matter.
  is indeed nearly bed time-   those,   least,   can sleep  
spite   sorrow.     myself, heaven has given     life   such
unmeasurable woe,   even   day when   am attending     duties
  looking after   servants,   am still weeping   lamenting during
  whole time; then, when night comes,         us     bed,
  lie awake thinking,     heart comes   prey     most incessant

    suitors are eating     property. Listen, then,     dream

down     mountain,   dug   curved beak into   neck   each

told     leave off crying. '    good courage,'   said, 'daughter

bring these suitors     disgraceful end.'       woke,   when
  looked     saw   geese     trough eating   mash   usual."

"  dream, Madam," replied Ulysses, "can admit but     interpretation,
  had   Ulysses himself told   how   shall   fulfilled?  
death     suitors is portended,       single     them
  escape." 

  Penelope answered, "Stranger, dreams are very curious   unaccountable
things,           any means invariably come true.   are
two gates through   these unsubstantial fancies proceed;    
is   horn,     other ivory. Those   come through   gate
  ivory are fatuous, but those     gate   horn mean something

But even  ,   doubt       shall remember       dreams."

Then Ulysses answered, "Madam wife   Ulysses,   need   defer
your tournament,   Ulysses   return ere ever   can string
  bow, handle   how    ,   send   arrows through  
iron." 

    Penelope said, "  long, sir,       sit here   talk

She then went upstairs     own room,   alone, but attended  
  maidens,   when  , she lamented   dear husband till Minerva
shed sweet sleep over   eyelids.

BOOK XX

Ulysses slept     cloister upon   undressed bullock   hide,  
  top       threw several skins     sheep   suitors had
eaten,   Eurynome threw   cloak over him after   had laid himself
down.  , then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon   way  
    should kill   suitors;        ,   women   had
been     habit   misconducting themselves   them, left  
house giggling   laughing     another.   made Ulysses very
angry,     doubted whether         kill every single  
  them then    ,     let them sleep   more   last time
    suitors.   heart growled within him,       bitch  
puppies growls   shows   teeth when she sees   stranger,   did
  heart growl   anger     evil deeds   were being done:
but   beat   breast   said, "Heart,   still,   had worse than
    bear     day when   terrible Cyclops ate your brave companions;
yet   bore     silence till your cunning got   safe      
cave, though   made sure   being killed." 

Thus   chided     heart,   checked   into endurance, but
  tossed         turns   paunch full   blood   fat  
front     hot fire, doing   first     side   then     other,
    may     cooked   soon   possible, even   did   turn
himself     side   side, thinking     time how, single
handed     was,   should contrive   kill   large   body   men
    wicked suitors. But       Minerva came down   heaven
    likeness     woman,   hovered over   head saying, " 
poor unhappy man, why     lie awake     way?   is your house:
your wife is safe inside  ,     is your son   is just such  
young man   any father may   proud  ." 

"Goddess," answered Ulysses, "        said is true, but
  am   some doubt     how   shall   able   kill these wicked
suitors single handed, seeing     number   them   always are.
    is   further difficulty,   is still more considerable.
Supposing     Jove     your assistance   succeed   killing
them,   must ask     consider where   am   escape      
avengers when   is   over." 

"  shame," replied Minerva, "why, any   else   trust   worse
ally than myself, even though   ally were only   mortal   less
wise than   am. Am       goddess,         protected   throughout
    your troubles?   tell   plainly   even though   were
fifty bands   men surrounding us   eager   kill us,   should
take     sheep   cattle,   drive them away    . But
    sleep;   is   very bad thing   lie awake   night,    
shall       your troubles before long." 

  she spoke she shed sleep over   eyes,   then went back   Olympus.

While Ulysses was thus yielding himself     very deep slumber  
eased   burden     sorrows,   admirable wife awoke,   sitting
      bed began   cry. When she had relieved herself   weeping
she prayed   Diana saying, "Great Goddess Diana, daughter   Jove,
drive   arrow into   heart   slay  ;   let some whirlwind snatch
      bear   through paths   darkness till   drop   into  
mouths   overflowing Oceanus,     did   daughters   Pandareus.
  daughters   Pandareus lost   father   mother,     gods
killed them,     were left orphans. But Venus took care   them,
  fed them   cheese, honey,   sweet wine. Juno taught them  
excel   women   beauty   form   understanding; Diana gave them
  imposing presence,   Minerva endowed them   every kind  
accomplishment; but   day when Venus had gone     Olympus   see
Jove   getting them married (  well does   know both   shall
happen       happen   every  )   storm winds came  
spirited them away   become handmaids     dread Erinyes. Even
    wish     gods   live   heaven   hide     mortal
sight,     fair Diana might strike  ,       fain   even
beneath   sad earth     might     still looking towards Ulysses
only,   without having   yield myself     worse man than   was.
Besides, no matter how much people may grieve   day,   can put
        long     can sleep   night,   when   eyes are
closed   slumber people forget good   ill alike; whereas   misery
haunts   even     dreams.   very night methought   was  
lying     side   was like Ulysses     was when   went away
    host,     rejoiced,     believed     was no dream,
but   very truth itself." 

      day broke, but Ulysses heard   sound     weeping,
    puzzled him,     seemed   though she already knew him  
was     side. Then   gathered     cloak     fleeces  
    had lain,   set them     seat     cloister, but  
took   bullock   hide   into   open.   lifted     hands
  heaven,   prayed, saying "Father Jove, since     seen fit
  bring   over land   sea     own home after     afflictions
    laid upon  , give     sign       mouth   some  
  other   those   are now waking within   house,   let  
  another sign   some kind   outside." 

Thus did   pray. Jove heard   prayer   forthwith thundered high
  among       splendour   Olympus,   Ulysses was glad when
  heard  .     same time within   house,   miller woman  
hard       mill room lifted     voice   gave him another
sign.   were twelve miller women whose business   was   grind
wheat   barley   are   staff   life.   others had ground
  task   had gone   take   rest, but     had   yet
finished,   she was     strong     were,   when she heard
  thunder she stopped grinding   gave   sign     master.
"Father Jove," said she, "    rule over heaven   earth,  
  thundered     clear sky without   much     cloud    ,
    means something   somebody; grant   prayer, then,  
  your poor servant   calls upon  ,   let       very
last day     suitors dine     house   Ulysses.    
worn         labour   grinding meal   them,     hope
  may never   another dinner anywhere    ." 

Ulysses was glad when   heard   omens conveyed   him     woman  
speech,       thunder,     knew   meant     should
avenge himself     suitors. 

Then   other maids     house rose   lit   fire     hearth;
Telemachus also rose   put     clothes.   girded   sword  
  shoulder, bound   sandals     comely feet,   took   doughty
spear     point   sharpened bronze; then   went     threshold
    cloister   said   Euryclea, "Nurse, did   make   stranger
comfortable both   regards bed   board,   did   let him shift
  himself?-     mother, good woman though she is, has   way  
paying great attention   second rate people,     neglecting others
  are   reality much better men." 

"    find fault child," said Euryclea, "when   is no    
find fault  .   stranger sat   drank   wine   long    
liked: your mother did ask him       take any more bread  
  said      . When   wanted       bed she told   servants
  make     him, but   said   was re such wretched outcast  
      sleep     bed   under blankets;   insisted   having
  undressed bullock   hide   some sheepskins put   him    
cloister     threw   cloak over him myself." 

Then Telemachus went       court     place where   Achaeans
were meeting   assembly;   had   spear     hand,     was
  alone,     two dogs went   him. But Euryclea called  
maids   said, "Come, wake  ; set   sweeping   cloisters  
sprinkling them   water   lay   dust; put   covers    
seats; wipe down   tables, some    ,     wet sponge; clean
    mixing jugs     cups,     water     fountain
  once;   suitors     here directly;       here early,
    is   feast day." 

Thus did she speak,     did even   she had said: twenty   them
went     fountain   water,     others set themselves busily
  work     house.   men   were   attendance     suitors
also came     began chopping firewood.         women returned
    fountain,     swineherd came after them     three
best pigs   could pick  . These   let feed     premises,
  then   said good humouredly   Ulysses, "Stranger, are   suitors
treating   any better now,   are     insolent   ever?"

"May heaven," answered Ulysses, "requite   them   wickedness  
    deal high handedly   another man   house without any sense
  shame." 

Thus did   converse; meanwhile Melanthius   goatherd came  ,
    too was bringing     best goats     suitors' dinner;
    had two shepherds   him.   tied   goats   under  
gatehouse,   then Melanthius began gibing   Ulysses. "Are   still
here, stranger," said  , "  pester people   begging     house?
Why can       elsewhere?       shall   come     understanding
before     given each other   taste   our fists.   beg without
any sense   decency: are     feasts elsewhere among   Achaeans,
  well   here?" 

Ulysses made no answer, but bowed   head   brooded. Then   third
man, Philoetius, joined them,   was bringing     barren heifer
  some goats. These were brought over     boatmen   are  
  take people over when any   comes   them.   Philoetius made
  heifer     goats secure under   gatehouse,   then went
      swineherd. " , Swineherd," said  , "is   stranger
  is lately come here? Is       your men?   is   family?
Where does   come  ? Poor fellow,   looks       had been some
great man, but   gods give sorrow   whom    - even   kings
      pleases them 

    spoke   went     Ulysses   saluted him     right hand;
"Good day    , father stranger," said  , "  seem     very
poorly off now, but   hope       better times      . Father
Jove,     gods   are   most malicious.   are your own children,
yet   show us no mercy     our misery   afflictions.   sweat
came over   when   saw   man,     eyes filled   tears,  
  reminds     Ulysses,     fear is going     just such rags
    man   are,   indeed   is still among   living.     is
already dead       house   Hades, then, alas!     good master,
  made     stockman when   was quite young among   Cephallenians,
  now   cattle are countless; no   could   done better  
them than    ,       bred like ears   corn; nevertheless
      keep bringing them     others   eat,   take no heed
    son though   is     house,   fear     wrath   heaven,
but are already eager   divide Ulysses' property among them because
  has been away   long.     often thought- only      
  right while   son is living-   going off     cattle  
some foreign country; bad        ,   is still harder  
stay here     ill treated   other people   herds.   position
is intolerable,     should long since   run away   put myself
under   protection   some other chief, only     believe   poor
master   yet return,   send   these suitors flying      
house." 

"Stockman," answered Ulysses, "  seem       very well disposed
person,     can see     are   man   sense. Therefore    
tell  ,     confirm   words     oath:   Jove,   chief
    gods,       hearth   Ulysses       am now come,
Ulysses shall return before   leave   place,       are  
minded   shall see him killing   suitors   are now masters here."

"  Jove were   bring     pass," replied   stockman, "  should
see how         very utmost   help him." 

    like manner Eumaeus prayed   Ulysses might return home.

Thus did   converse. Meanwhile   suitors were hatching   plot
  murder Telemachus: but   bird flew near them     left hand-
  eagle     dove   its talons.     Amphinomus said, "  friends,
  plot   ours   murder Telemachus     succeed; let us  
  dinner instead." 

  others assented,     went inside   laid   cloaks  
  benches   seats.   sacrificed   sheep, goats, pigs,  
  heifer,   when   inward meats were cooked   served them
round.   mixed   wine     mixing bowls,     swineherd
gave every man   cup, while Philoetius handed round   bread  
  breadbaskets,   Melanthius poured them     wine. Then
  laid   hands upon   good things   were before them.

Telemachus purposely made Ulysses sit     part     cloister
  was paved   stone;   gave him   shabby looking seat    
little table   himself,   had   portion     inward meats brought
  him,     wine     gold cup. "Sit  ," said  , "  drink
your wine among   great people.     put   stop     gibes  
blows     suitors,     is no public house, but belongs  
Ulysses,   has passed   him    . Therefore, suitors, keep your
hands   your tongues   yourselves,         mischief."

  suitors bit   lips,   marvelled     boldness     speech;
then Antinous said, "      like such language but     put
     ,   Telemachus is threatening us   good earnest.   Jove
had let us   should   put   stop     brave talk ere now."

Thus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him  . Meanwhile  
heralds were bringing   holy hecatomb through   city,    
Achaeans gathered under   shady grove   Apollo. 

Then   roasted   outer meat, drew   off   spits, gave every
man   portion,   feasted     hearts' content; those   waited
  table gave Ulysses exactly   same portion     others had,
  Telemachus had told them      . 

But Minerva     let   suitors     moment drop   insolence,
  she wanted Ulysses   become still more bitter against them. Now
  happened     among them   ribald fellow, whose name was Ctesippus,
    came   Same.   man, confident     great wealth, was
paying court     wife   Ulysses,   said     suitors, "Hear
         .   stranger has already had   large   portion
  any   else;   is well,     is   right nor reasonable
  ill treat any guest   Telemachus   comes here.    , however,
make him   present     own account,     may   something  
give     bath woman,     some other   Ulysses' servants."

    spoke   picked     heifer   foot     meat basket    
  lay,   threw     Ulysses, but Ulysses turned   head   little
aside,   avoided  , smiling grimly Sardinian fashion     did
 ,     hit   wall,   him.     Telemachus spoke fiercely
  Ctesippus, "  is   good thing    ," said  , "    stranger
turned   head       missed him.     had hit him   should
  run   through     spear,   your father     had
  see   getting   buried rather than married     house.
  let     no more unseemly behaviour   any    ,     am
grown   now     knowledge   good   evil   understand  
is going  , instead   being   child       been heretofore.
    long seen   killing   sheep   making free     corn
  wine:     put      ,     man is no match   many,
but     no further violence. Still,     wish   kill  , kill
 ;     far rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day after
day- guests insulted,   men dragging   women servants    
house     unseemly way." 

    held   peace till   last Agelaus son   Damastor said,
"No   should take offence     has just been said, nor gainsay
 ,     is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill treating
  stranger,   any   else     servants   are     house;
     , however,   friendly word   Telemachus     mother,
    trust may commend itself   both. '  long,'      ,
'    had ground   hoping   Ulysses     day come home,
no   could complain   your waiting   suffering   suitors  
    your house.       been better     should   returned,
but   is now sufficiently clear       never    ; therefore
talk     quietly over   your mother,   tell     marry
  best man,         makes     most advantageous offer.
Thus     yourself   able   manage your own inheritance,  
  eat   drink   peace, while your mother   look after some
other man   house,   yours."' 

    Telemachus answered, "  Jove, Agelaus,       sorrows
    unhappy father,   has either perished far   Ithaca,  
is wandering   some distant land,   throw no obstacles     way
    mother   marriage;     contrary   urge     choose whomsoever
she  ,       give   numberless gifts into   bargain, but
  dare   insist point blank   she shall leave   house against
  own wishes. Heaven forbid     should    ." 

Minerva now made   suitors fall   laughing immoderately,   set
  wits wandering; but   were laughing     forced laughter.
  meat became smeared   blood;   eyes filled   tears,
    hearts were heavy   forebodings. Theoclymenus saw  
  said, "Unhappy men,   is     ails  ?   is   shroud
  darkness drawn over     head   foot, your cheeks are wet
  tears;   air is alive   wailing voices;   walls   roof beams
drip blood;   gate     cloisters     court beyond them are
full   ghosts trooping down into   night   hell;   sun is blotted
    heaven,     blighting gloom is over     land."

Thus did   speak,         them laughed heartily. Eurymachus
then said, "  stranger   has lately come here has lost   senses.
Servants, turn him   into   streets, since   finds     dark
here." 

But Theoclymenus said, "Eurymachus,   need   send any    
 .     eyes, ears,     pair   feet     own,     nothing
    understanding mind.     take these       house  
 ,     see mischief overhanging  ,            
men   are insulting people   plotting ill deeds     house  
Ulysses     able   escape." 

  left   house     spoke,   went back   Piraeus   gave him
welcome, but   suitors kept looking     another   provoking
Telemachus fly laughing     strangers.   insolent fellow said
  him, "Telemachus,   are   happy   your guests; first    
  importunate tramp,   comes begging bread   wine   has no
skill   work     hard fighting, but is perfectly useless,  
now here is another fellow   is setting himself       prophet.
Let   persuade  ,         much better,   put them   board
ship   send them off     Sicels   sell         bring."

Telemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching   father,
expecting every moment       begin   attack upon   suitors.

Meanwhile   daughter   Icarius, wise Penelope, had had had   rich
seat placed     facing   court   cloisters,     she could
hear   every   was saying.   dinner indeed had been prepared
amid merriment;   had been both good   abundant,     had sacrificed
many victims; but   supper was yet   come,   nothing can   conceived
more gruesome than   meal     goddess     brave man were soon
  lay before them-     had brought   doom upon themselves.

BOOK XXI

Minerva now put     Penelope   mind   make   suitors try  
skill     bow       iron axes,   contest among themselves,
    means   bringing     destruction. She went upstairs
  got   store room key,   was made   bronze   had   handle
  ivory; she then went     maidens into   store room    
end     house, where   husband   treasures   gold, bronze,  
wrought iron were kept,   where was also   bow,     quiver
full   deadly arrows   had been given him     friend whom  
had met   Lacedaemon- Iphitus   son   Eurytus.   two fell  
    another   Messene     house   Ortilochus, where Ulysses
was staying   order   recover   debt   was owing     whole
people;     Messenians had carried off three hundred sheep  
Ithaca,   had sailed away   them       shepherds.  
quest   these Ulysses took   long journey while still quite young,
    father     other chieftains sent him     mission   recover
them. Iphitus had gone   also   try     back twelve brood
mares     had lost,     mule foals   were running  
them. These mares were   death   him     end,   when   went
    house   Jove   son, mighty Hercules,   performed such prodigies
  valour, Hercules     shame killed him, though   was   guest,
    feared   heaven   vengeance, nor yet respected   own table
    had set before Iphitus, but killed him   spite   everything,
  kept   mares himself.   was when claiming these   Iphitus
met Ulysses,   gave him   bow   mighty Eurytus had been used
  carry,         death had been left   him     son.
Ulysses gave him   return   sword     spear,     was   beginning
    fast friendship, although   never visited     another  
houses,   Jove   son Hercules killed Iphitus ere   could    .
  bow, then, given him   Iphitus, had   been taken   him
  Ulysses when   sailed   Troy;   had used     long     had
been   home, but had left   behind   having been   keepsake  
  valued friend. 

Penelope presently reached   oak threshold     store room;  
carpenter had planed   duly,   had drawn   line          
    quite straight;   had then set   door posts into    
hung   doors. She loosed   strap     handle     door,
put     key,   drove   straight home   shoot back   bolts
  held   doors; these flew open     noise like   bull bellowing
    meadow,   Penelope stepped upon   raised platform, where
  chests stood       fair linen   clothes were laid  
along   fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down   bow
  its bow case     peg       hung. She sat down  
      knees, weeping bitterly   she took   bow     its case,
  when   tears had relieved  , she went     cloister where
  suitors were, carrying   bow     quiver,     many deadly
arrows   were inside  . Along     came   maidens, bearing
  chest   contained much iron   bronze     husband had
won   prizes. When she reached   suitors, she stood        
bearing posts supporting   roof     cloister, holding   veil
before   face,       maid   either side    . Then she said:

"Listen       suitors,   persist   abusing   hospitality
    house because its owner has been long absent,   without
other pretext than     want   marry  ;  , then, being  
prize     are contending  ,     bring     mighty bow
  Ulysses,   whomsoever     shall string   most easily  
send   arrow through each     twelve axes, him     follow
  quit   house     lawful husband,   goodly,     abounding
  wealth. But even     doubt       shall remember      
dreams." 

  she spoke, she told Eumaeus   set   bow     pieces   iron
before   suitors,   Eumaeus wept     took them       she
had bidden him. Hard  ,   stockman wept also when   saw   master  
bow, but Antinous scolded them. "  country louts," said  , "silly
simpletons; why should   add     sorrows   your mistress  
crying     way? She has enough   grieve       loss    
husband; sit still, therefore,   eat your dinners   silence,  
  outside     want   cry,   leave   bow behind  .   suitors
shall     contend       might   main,     shall find
  no light matter   string such   bow     is.   is    
man   us     is such another   Ulysses;       seen him
  remember him, though   was then only   child." 

  was     said, but     time   was expecting     able
  string   bow   shoot through   iron, whereas   fact   was
      first   should taste     arrows     hands  
Ulysses, whom   was dishonouring     own house- egging   others
        also. 

Then Telemachus spoke. "Great heavens!"   exclaimed, "Jove must  
robbed       senses. Here is   dear   excellent mother saying
she   quit   house   marry again, yet   am laughing   enjoying
myself   though   were nothing happening. But, suitors,    
contest has been agreed upon, let     forward.   is     woman
whose peer is       found   Pylos, Argos,   Mycene, nor yet
  Ithaca nor     mainland.   know     well      ;  
need       speak   praise     mother? Come  , then, make no
excuses   delay, but let us see whether   can string   bow  
no.   too   make trial    ,       can string     shoot
through   iron,   shall   suffer   mother   quit   house
    stranger,       can win   prizes     father won before
 ." 

    spoke   sprang     seat, threw   crimson cloak  
him,   took   sword     shoulder. First   set   axes  
  row,     long groove     had dug   them,   had Wade straight
  line. Then   stamped   earth tight round them,   everyone
was surprised when   saw him set     orderly, though   had never
seen anything     kind before.   done,   went       pavement
  make trial     bow; thrice did   tug    , trying    
  might   draw   string,   thrice   had   leave off, though
  had hoped   string   bow   shoot through   iron.   was
trying     fourth time,       strung   had   Ulysses
made   sign   check him   spite       eagerness.     said:

"Alas!   shall either   always feeble     no prowess,     am
too young,       yet reached   full strength         able
  hold   own   any   attacks  .   others, therefore,   are
stronger than  , make trial     bow       contest settled."

      put   bow down, letting   lean against   door [ 
led into   house]     arrow standing against   top    
bow. Then   sat down     seat       had risen,   Antinous
said: 

"Come   each         turn, going towards   right    
place      . cupbearer begins when   is handing round  
wine." 

  rest agreed,   Leiodes son   OEnops was   first   rise.
  was sacrificial priest     suitors,   sat     corner near
  mixing bowl.   was   only man   hated   evil deeds  
was indignant     others.   was now   first   take   bow
  arrow,     went       pavement   make   trial, but  
could   string   bow,     hands were weak   unused   hard
work,   therefore soon grew tired,     said     suitors,
"  friends,   cannot string  ; let another    ;   bow shall
take   life   soul     many   chief among us,     is better
  die than   live after having missed   prize        
long striven  ,     has brought us   long together. Some
    us is even now hoping   praying     may marry Penelope,
but when   has seen   bow   tried  , let him woo   make bridal
offerings   some other woman,   let Penelope marry whoever makes
    best offer   whose lot   is   win  ." 

      put   bow down, letting   lean against   door,  
  arrow standing against   tip     bow. Then   took   seat
again     seat       had risen;   Antinous rebuked him
saying: 

"Leiodes,   are   talking  ? Your words are monstrous  
intolerable;   makes   angry   listen    . Shall, then,  
bow take   life   many   chief among us, merely because   cannot
bend   yourself? True,   were   born       archer, but  
are others     soon string  ." 

Then   said   Melanthius   goatherd, "Look sharp, light   fire
    court,   set   seat hard       sheep skin    ; bring
us also   large ball   lard,             house. Let
us warm   bow   grease       then make trial     again,
  bring   contest     end." 

Melanthius lit   fire,   set   seat covered   sheep skins beside
 .   also brought   great ball   lard       had    
house,     suitors warmed   bow   again made trial    ,
but   were none   them nearly strong enough   string  . Nevertheless
  still remained Antinous   Eurymachus,   were   ringleaders
among   suitors   much   foremost among them  . 

Then   swineherd     stockman left   cloisters together,  
Ulysses followed them. When   had got outside   gates    
outer yard, Ulysses said   them quietly: 

"Stockman,     swineherd,     something     mind    
am   doubt whether       no; but   think        .  
manner   men         stand   Ulysses,   some god should
bring him back here       sudden?       are disposed  
 -   side     suitors,     Ulysses?" 

"Father Jove," answered   stockman, "  indeed     might
  ordain  .   some god were but   bring Ulysses back,   should
see     might   main     fight   him." 

  like words Eumaeus prayed       gods   Ulysses might return;
when, therefore,   saw   certain   mind   were  , Ulysses
said, "  is  , Ulysses,   am here.     suffered much, but  
last,     twentieth year,   am come back     own country.   find
    two alone       servants are glad     should    ,
        heard any     others praying     return.    
two, therefore,     unfold   truth     shall  .   heaven
shall deliver   suitors into   hands,     find wives   both
   ,   give   house   holding close     own,     shall
        though   were brothers   friends   Telemachus.  
  now give   convincing proofs     may know       assured.
See, here is   scar     boar   tooth   ripped   when  
was   hunting   Mount Parnassus     sons   Autolycus."

    spoke   drew   rags aside     great scar,   when  
had examined   thoroughly,   both   them wept   Ulysses,
threw   arms round him   kissed   head   shoulders, while
Ulysses kissed   hands   faces   return.   sun    
gone down upon   mourning   Ulysses had   checked them  
said: 

"Cease your weeping, lest some   should come outside   see us,
  tell those     are within. When      ,     separately,
  both together;       first,       follow afterwards;
Let   moreover     token between us;   suitors      
them try   prevent     getting hold     bow   quiver;  
 , therefore, Eumaeus, place       hands when   are carrying
   ,   tell   women   close   doors     apartment.
    hear any groaning   uproar     men fighting     house,
  must   come  ;   must keep quiet,   stay where  
are     work.     charge  , Philoetius,   make fast  
doors     outer court,     bind them securely   once."

When   had thus spoken,   went back     house   took   seat
    had left. Presently,   two servants followed him inside.

    moment   bow was     hands   Eurymachus,   was warming
      fire, but even     could   string  ,     was greatly
grieved.   heaved   deep sigh   said, "  grieve   myself  
  us  ;   grieve     shall     forgo   marriage, but
      care nearly   much    ,     are plenty   other
women   Ithaca   elsewhere;     feel most is   fact   our
being   inferior   Ulysses   strength     cannot string  
bow.     disgrace us     eyes   those   are yet unborn."

"  shall      , Eurymachus," said Antinous, "    know  
yourself.   day is   feast   Apollo throughout     land;  
can string   bow   such   day    ? Put       side-    
  axes   can stay where   are,   no   is likely   come
    house   take them away: let   cupbearer   round    
cups,     may make our drink offerings   drop   matter  
  bow;     tell Melanthius   bring us   some goats   morrow-
  best   has;   can then offer thigh bones   Apollo   mighty
archer,   again make trial     bow,       bring   contest
    end." 

  rest approved   words,   thereon men servants poured water
over   hands     guests, while pages filled   mixing bowls
  wine   water   handed   round after giving every man  
drink offering. Then, when   had made   offerings   had drunk
each   much     desired, Ulysses craftily said: 

"Suitors     illustrious queen, listen     may speak even  
  am minded.   appeal more especially   Eurymachus,     Antinous
  has just spoken     much reason. Cease shooting     present
  leave   matter     gods, but     morning let heaven give
victory   whom    .     moment, however, give     bow
    may prove   power     hands among    ,   see whether
  still     much strength     used    ,   whether travel
  neglect   made   end    ." 

  made them   very angry,     feared   might string  
bow; Antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, "Wretched creature,
        much     grain   sense   your whole body;   ought
  think yourself lucky   being allowed   dine unharmed among your
betters, without having any smaller portion served   than   others
  had,     being allowed   hear our conversation. No other
beggar   stranger has been allowed   hear       among ourselves;
  wine must   been doing     mischief,     does    
those drink immoderately.   was wine   inflamed   Centaur Eurytion
when   was staying   Peirithous among   Lapithae. When   wine
had got into   head   went mad   did ill deeds     house
  Peirithous;   angered   heroes   were   assembled,  
  rushed   him   cut off   ears   nostrils; then   dragged
him through   doorway       house,     went away crazed,
  bore   burden     crime, bereft   understanding. Henceforth,
therefore,   was war between mankind     centaurs, but  
brought   upon himself through   own drunkenness.   like manner
  can tell           hardly         string   bow:
    find no mercy   any   here,     shall   once ship
  off   king Echetus,   kills every     comes near him:
    never   away alive,   drink   keep quiet without getting
into   quarrel   men younger than yourself." 

Penelope then spoke   him. "Antinous," said she, "  is   right
    should ill treat any guest   Telemachus   comes    
house.     stranger should prove strong enough   string   mighty
bow   Ulysses, can   suppose       take   home   him
  make     wife? Even   man himself can   no such idea  
  mind: none     need let   disturb   feasting;    
        reason." 

"Queen Penelope," answered Eurymachus, "      suppose    
man   take   away   him;   is impossible; but   are afraid
lest some     baser sort, men   women among   Achaeans, should
  gossiping      , 'These suitors are   feeble folk;  
are paying court     wife     brave man whose bow       them
was able   string,   yet   beggarly tramp   came     house
strung     once   sent   arrow through   iron.'   is  
    said,           scandal against us." 

"Eurymachus," Penelope answered, "people   persist   eating  
  estate     great chieftain   dishonouring   house must  
expect others   think well   them. Why then should   mind   men
talk     think    ?   stranger is strong   well built,
  says moreover     is   noble birth. Give him   bow,  
let us see whether   can string     no.    -     shall surely
 -     Apollo vouchsafes him   glory   stringing  ,    
give him   cloak   shirt   good wear,     javelin   keep off
dogs   robbers,     sharp sword.     also give him sandals,
    see him sent safely whereever   wants    ." 

Then Telemachus said, "Mother,   am   only man either   Ithaca
      islands   are over against Elis   has   right  
let any       bow     refuse  . No   shall force    
way     other,   even though   choose   make   stranger  
present     bow outright,   let him take   away   him.  ,
then, within   house   busy yourself   your daily duties, your
loom, your distaff,     ordering   your servants.   bow is
  man   matter,   mine above   others,     is     am master
here." 

She went wondering back into   house,   laid   son   saying
    heart. Then going upstairs     handmaids into   room,
she mourned   dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over  
eyelids. 

  swineherd now took     bow   was   taking     Ulysses,
but   suitors clamoured   him     parts     cloisters,
      them said, "  idiot, where are   taking   bow  ?
Are       your wits?   Apollo     other gods   grant
our prayer, your own boarhounds shall     into some quiet little
place,   worry     death." 

Eumaeus was frightened     outcry     raised,     put  
bow down then    , but Telemachus shouted     him    
other side     cloisters,   threatened him saying, "Father Eumaeus,
bring   bow     spite   them,   young     am     pelt  
  stones back     country,     am   better man     two.
  wish   was   much stronger than     other suitors     house
    am than  ,     soon send some   them off sick   sorry,
    mean mischief." 

Thus did   speak,         them laughed heartily,   put
them     better humour   Telemachus;   Eumaeus brought   bow
    placed       hands   Ulysses. When   had done  ,  
called Euryclea apart   said    , "Euryclea, Telemachus says
  are   close   doors     women   apartments.     hear
any groaning   uproar     men fighting     house,   are
    come  , but are   keep quiet   stay where   are  
  work." 

Euryclea did   she was told   closed   doors     women   apartments.

Meanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly     made fast   gates  
  outer court.   was   ship   cable   byblus fibre lying  
  gatehouse,     made   gates fast       then came  
again, resuming   seat     had left,   keeping   eye   Ulysses,
  had now got   bow     hands,   was turning   every way
 ,   proving     over   see whether   worms had been eating
into its two horns during   absence. Then     turn towards
  neighbour saying, "  is some tricky old bow fancier; either
  has got   like     home,     wants   make  ,   such workmanlike
style does   old vagabond handle  ." 

Another said, "  hope   may   no more successful   other things
than   is likely       stringing   bow." 

But Ulysses, when   had taken       examined     over, strung
    easily     skilled bard strings   new peg     lyre   makes
  twisted gut fast   both ends. Then   took       right hand
  prove   string,     sang sweetly under   touch like  
twittering     swallow.   suitors were dismayed,   turned colour
    heard  ;     moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly
    sign,     heart   Ulysses rejoiced     heard   omen
    son   scheming Saturn had sent him. 

  took   arrow   was lying upon   table-   those    
Achaeans were   shortly     taste were   inside   quiver-
  laid       centre piece     bow,   drew   notch    
arrow     string toward him, still seated     seat. When  
had taken aim   let fly,     arrow pierced every       handle holes
    axes     first onwards till   had gone right through
them,   into   outer courtyard. Then   said   Telemachus:

"Your guest has   disgraced  , Telemachus.   did   miss  
  aimed  ,     was   long   stringing   bow.   am still strong,
        suitors twit     being. Now, however,   is time
    Achaeans   prepare supper while   is still daylight,
  then otherwise   disport themselves   song   dance  
are   crowning ornaments     banquet." 

    spoke   made   sign     eyebrows,   Telemachus girded
    sword, grasped   spear,   stood armed beside   father  
seat.

BOOK XXII

Then Ulysses tore off   rags,   sprang       broad pavement
    bow     quiver full   arrows.   shed   arrows  
    ground     feet   said, "  mighty contest is     end.
    now see whether Apollo   vouchsafe         hit another
mark   no man has yet hit." 

      aimed   deadly arrow   Antinous,   was     take
    two handled gold cup   drink   wine   already had    
  hands.   had no thought   death-   amongst     revellers
  think     man, however brave,   stand alone among  
many   kill him?   arrow struck Antinous     throat,    
point went clean through   neck,       fell over     cup
dropped     hand, while   thick stream   blood gushed    
nostrils.   kicked   table   him   upset   things    ,
      bread   roasted meats were   soiled     fell over
      ground.   suitors were     uproar when   saw  
  man had been hit;   sprang   dismay         them  
  seats   looked everywhere towards   walls, but   was
neither shield nor spear,     rebuked Ulysses very angrily. "Stranger,"
said  , "  shall pay   shooting people     way: om yi  
shall see no other contest;   are   doomed man;   whom    
slain was   foremost youth   Ithaca,     vultures shall devour
    having killed him." 

Thus   spoke,     thought     had killed Antinous   mistake,
  did   perceive   death was hanging over   head   every
    them. But Ulysses glared   them   said: 

"Dogs, did   think     should   come back   Troy?    
wasted   substance,   forced   women servants   lie    ,
    wooed   wife while   was still living.     feared neither
Cod nor man,   now   shall die." 

  turned pale   fear     spoke,   every man looked round
    see whither   might fly   safety, but Eurymachus alone
spoke. 

"    are Ulysses," said  , "then       said is just.  
  done much wrong   your lands     your house. But Antinous
  was   head   front     offending lies low already.   was
    doing.   was       wanted   marry Penelope;   did
    much care    ;     wanted was something quite different,
  Jove has   vouchsafed     him;   wanted   kill your son
      chief man   Ithaca. Now, therefore,     has met  
death   was   due, spare   lives   your people.     make
everything good among ourselves,   pay     full      
    eaten   drunk. Each     us shall pay     fine worth
twenty oxen,       keep   giving   gold   bronze till your
heart is softened. Until     done   no   can complain  
your being enraged against us." 

Ulysses again glared   him   said, "Though   should give    
          world both now         ever shall  ,
      stay   hand till     paid         full.   must
fight,   fly   your lives;   fly,     man     shall."

  hearts sank     heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:

"  friends,   man   give us no quarter.     stand where
  is   shoot us down till   has killed every man among us. Let
us then show fight; draw your swords,   hold     tables   shield
      arrows. Let us     him     rush,   drive him
    pavement   doorway:   can then   through into   town,
  raise such   alarm   shall soon stay   shooting."

    spoke   drew   keen blade   bronze, sharpened   both sides,
      loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses instantly
shot   arrow into   breast   caught him     nipple   fixed
itself     liver.   dropped   sword   fell doubled   over
  table.   cup       meats went over       ground  
  smote   earth     forehead     agonies   death,  
  kicked   stool     feet until   eyes were closed   darkness.

Then Amphinomus drew   sword   made straight   Ulysses   try
    him away     door; but Telemachus was too quick   him,
  struck him   behind;   spear caught him between   shoulders
  went right through   chest,       fell heavily     ground
  struck   earth     forehead. Then Telemachus sprang away
  him, leaving   spear still     body,     feared  
    stayed   draw    , some       Achaeans might come  
  hack   him     sword,   knock him down,     set off  
  run,   immediately was     father   side. Then   said:

"Father, let   bring     shield, two spears,     brass helmet
  your temples.     arm myself   well,     bring other
armour     swineherd     stockman,     had better   armed."

"Run   fetch them," answered Ulysses, "while   arrows hold  ,
  when   am alone   may     away     door." 

Telemachus did     father said,   went off     store room
where   armour was kept.   chose four shields, eight spears,  
four brass helmets   horse hair plumes.   brought them    
speed     father,   armed himself first, while   stockman  
  swineherd also put     armour,   took   places near
Ulysses. Meanwhile Ulysses,   long     arrows lasted, had been
shooting   suitors      ,     fell thick     another:
when   arrows gave  ,   set   bow   stand against   end
wall     house     door post,   hung   shield four hides thick
    shoulders;     comely head   set   helmet, well wrought
    crest   horse hair   nodded menacingly above  ,    
grasped two redoubtable bronze shod spears. 

Now   was   trap door     wall, while     end     pavement
  was   exit leading     narrow passage,     exit was closed
    well made door. Ulysses told Philoetius   stand     door
  guard  ,   only   person could attack       time. But Agelaus
shouted  , "Cannot some           trap door   tell  
people   is going  ? Help   come   once,     should soon
make   end     man     shooting." 

"  may    , Agelaus," answered Melanthius, "  mouth    
narrow passage is dangerously near   entrance     outer court.
  brave man could prevent any number   getting  . But   know
       ,     bring   arms     store room,     am
sure   is     Ulysses     son   put them."

      goatherd Melanthius went   back passages     store
room   Ulysses, house.     chose twelve shields,     many
helmets   spears,   brought them back   fast     could   give
them     suitors. Ulysses' heart began   fail him when   saw
  suitors putting     armour   brandishing   spears.
  saw   greatness     danger,   said   Telemachus, "Some
      women inside is helping   suitors against us,     may
  Melanthius." 

Telemachus answered, "  fault, father, is mine,   mine only;  
left   store room door open,       kept   sharper look  
than    .  , Eumaeus, put   door  ,   see whether   is  
    women   is doing  ,   whether,     suspect,   is Melanthius
  son   Dolius." 

Thus did   converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going    
store room   fetch more armour, but   swineherd saw him   said
  Ulysses   was beside him, "Ulysses, noble son   Laertes,  
is   scoundrel Melanthius, just     suspected,   is going  
  store room.  , shall   kill him,     can     better  
him,   shall   bring him here     may take your own revenge
      many wrongs     has done   your house?"

Ulysses answered, "Telemachus       hold these suitors   check,
no matter      ;   back both       bind Melanthius' hands
  feet behind him. Throw him into   store room   make   door
fast behind  ; then fasten   noose     body,   string him
close       rafters     high bearing post,     may linger
      agony." 

Thus did   speak,     did even     had said;   went  
  store room,     entered before Melanthius saw them,  
  was busy searching   arms     innermost part     room,
    two took   stand   either side     door   waited.
      Melanthius came       helmet     hand,     old
dry rotted shield     other,   had been borne   Laertes when
  was young, but   had been long since thrown aside,    
straps had become unsewn;       two seized him, dragged him
back     hair,   threw him struggling     ground.   bent
  hands   feet well behind   back,   bound them tight  
  painful bond   Ulysses had told them; then   fastened   noose
    body   strung him       high pillar till   was close
      rafters,   over him did   then vaunt,   swineherd Eumaeus,
saying, "Melanthius,     pass   night     soft bed    
deserve.     know very well when morning comes     streams
  Oceanus,     is time         driving   your goats  
  suitors   feast  ." 

 , then,   left him   very cruel bondage,   having put  
  armour   closed   door behind them   went back   take
  places     side   Ulysses; whereon   four men stood  
  cloister, fierce   full   fury; nevertheless, those   were
    body     court were still both brave   many. Then Jove  
daughter Minerva came     them, having assumed   voice   form
  Mentor. Ulysses was glad when   saw     said, "Mentor, lend
  your help,   forget   your old comrade, nor   many good turns
  has done  . Besides,   are   age mate." 

But     time   felt sure   was Minerva,     suitors  
  other side raised   uproar when   saw  . Agelaus was  
first   reproach  . "Mentor,"   cried, "    let Ulysses beguile
  into siding   him   fighting   suitors.   is    
   : when     killed these people, father   son,    
kill   too.   shall pay       your head,   when    
killed  ,     take      ,   doors    ,   bring
  into hotch pot   Ulysses' property;       let your sons
live   your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widow continue
  live     city   Ithaca." 

  made Minerva still more furious,   she scolded Ulysses very
angrily. "Ulysses," said she, "your strength   prowess are no longer
    were when   fought   nine long years among   Trojans
    noble lady Helen.   killed many   man   those days,  
  was through your stratagem   Priam   city was taken. How comes
      are   lamentably less valiant now     are   your
own ground, face   face     suitors   your own house? Come
 ,   good fellow, stand     side   see how Mentor, son   Alcinous
shall fight your foes   requite your kindnesses conferred upon him."

But she     give him full victory   yet,   she wished still
further   prove   own prowess         brave son,   she
flew           rafters     roof     cloister   sat
upon       form     swallow. 

Meanwhile Agelaus son   Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus,
Pisander,   Polybus son   Polyctor bore   brunt     fight
upon   suitors' side;     those   were still fighting    
lives   were   far   most valiant,     others had already
fallen under   arrows   Ulysses. Agelaus shouted   them   said,
"  friends,     soon     leave off,   Mentor has gone away
after having done nothing   him but brag.   are standing    
doors unsupported.     aim   him     once, but six     throw
your spears first,   see     cannot cover yourselves   glory
  killing him. When   has fallen   need     uneasy    
others." 

  threw   spears     bade them, but Minerva made them  
  no effect.   hit   door post; another went against   door;
  pointed shaft   another struck   wall;     soon    
had avoided     spears     suitors Ulysses said     own
men, "  friends,   should     too had better let drive into  
middle   them,       crown     harm     done us
  us outright." 

  therefore aimed straight   front   them   threw   spears.
Ulysses killed Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus,
while   stockman killed Pisander. These   bit   dust,    
  others drew back into   corner Ulysses     men rushed forward
  regained   spears   drawing them     bodies     dead.

  suitors now aimed   second time, but again Minerva made  
weapons     most part without effect.   hit   bearing post  
  cloister; another went against   door; while   pointed shaft
  another struck   wall. Still, Amphimedon just took   piece  
  top skin   off Telemachus   wrist,   Ctesippus managed  
graze Eumaeus   shoulder above   shield; but   spear went    
fell     ground. Then Ulysses     men let drive into   crowd
  suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon,   Eumaeus
Polybus. After     stockman hit Ctesippus     breast,  
taunted him saying, "Foul mouthed son   Polytherses,        
foolish     talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your
speech,     gods are far stronger than men.   make     present
    advice   repay       foot     gave Ulysses when
  was begging       own house." 

Thus spoke   stockman,   Ulysses struck   son   Damastor  
  spear   close fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son   Evenor
    belly,     dart went clean through him,       fell
forward full     face upon   ground. Then Minerva     seat
    rafter held     deadly aegis,     hearts     suitors
quailed.   fled     other end     court like   herd   cattle
maddened     gadfly   early summer when   days are    
longest.   eagle beaked, crook taloned vultures     mountains
swoop down     smaller birds   cower   flocks upon   ground,
  kill them,     cannot either fight   fly,   lookers  
enjoy   sport- even   did Ulysses     men fall upon   suitors
  smite them   every side.   made   horrible groaning    
brains were being battered  ,     ground seethed     blood.

Leiodes then caught   knees   Ulysses   said, "Ulysses   beseech
    mercy upon     spare  .   never wronged any     women
  your house either   word   deed,     tried   stop   others.
  saw them, but       listen,   now   are paying  
  folly.   was   sacrificing priest;     kill  ,   shall
die without having done anything   deserve  ,   shall   got
no thanks       good     did." 

Ulysses looked sternly   him   answered, "    were   sacrificing
priest,   must   prayed many   time     might   long before
  got home again,       might marry   wife     children
   . Therefore   shall die." 

  these words   picked     sword   Agelaus had dropped when
  was being killed,     was lying upon   ground. Then  
struck Leiodes     back     neck,       head fell rolling
    dust while   was yet speaking. 

  minstrel Phemius son   Terpes-     had been forced    
suitors   sing   them- now tried   save   life.   was standing
near towards   trap door,   held   lyre     hand.   did
  know whether   fly       cloister   sit down     altar
  Jove   was     outer court,       both Laertes  
Ulysses had offered     thigh bones   many   ox,   whether  
  straight     Ulysses   embrace   knees, but     end  
deemed   best   embrace Ulysses' knees.     laid   lyre    
ground   ground between   mixing bowl     silver studded seat;
then going     Ulysses   caught hold     knees   said, "Ulysses,
  beseech     mercy       spare  .       sorry  
  afterwards     kill   bard   can sing both   gods   men
    can.   make     lays myself,   heaven visits     every
kind   inspiration.     sing       though   were   god,
    therefore     such   hurry   cut   head off. Your own son
Telemachus   tell       did   want   frequent your house
  sing     suitors after   meals, but   were too many
  too strong    ,     made  ." 

Telemachus heard him,     once went       father. "Hold!"  
cried, "  man is guiltless,   him no hurt;       Medon too,
  was always good     when   was   boy, unless Philoetius   Eumaeus
has already killed him,     has fallen   your way when   were
raging     court." 

Medon caught these words   Telemachus,     was crouching under
  seat beneath     had hidden   covering himself       freshly
flayed heifer   hide,     threw off   hide, went     Telemachus,
  laid hold     knees. 

"Here   am,   dear sir," said  , "stay your hand therefore,  
tell your father,       kill       rage against   suitors
  having wasted   substance   been   foolishly disrespectful
  yourself." 

Ulysses smiled   him   answered, "Fear  ; Telemachus has saved
your life,     may know   future,   tell other people, how
greatly better good deeds prosper than evil ones.  , therefore, outside
  cloisters into   outer court,           way     slaughter-
      bard- while   finish   work here inside." 

  pair went into   outer court   fast     could,   sat
down   Jove   great altar, looking fearfully round,   still expecting
        killed. Then Ulysses searched   whole court carefully
over,   see   anyone had managed   hide himself   was still living,
but   found them   lying     dust   weltering     blood.
  were like fishes   fishermen   netted       sea,
  thrown upon   beach   lie gasping   water till   heat  
  sun makes   end   them. Even   were   suitors lying   huddled
    against   other. 

Then Ulysses said   Telemachus, "Call nurse Euryclea;     something
       ." 

Telemachus went   knocked     door     women   room. "Make
haste," said  , "  old woman     been set over     other
women     house. Come outside;   father wishes   speak    ."

When Euryclea heard   she unfastened   door     women   room
  came  , following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among   corpses
bespattered   blood   filth like   lion   has just been devouring
  ox,     breast   both   cheeks are   bloody,    
  is   fearful sight; even   was Ulysses besmirched   head  
foot   gore. When she saw     corpses   such   quantity  
blood, she was beginning   cry     joy,   she saw     great
deed had been done; but Ulysses checked  , "Old woman," said  ,
"rejoice   silence; restrain yourself,       make any noise
   ;   is   unholy thing   vaunt over dead men. Heaven   doom
    own evil deeds   brought these men   destruction,  
  respected no man     whole world, neither rich nor poor,  
came near them,       come     bad end     punishment  
  wickedness   folly. Now, however, tell         women
    house   misconducted themselves,     are innocent."

"    tell     truth,   son," answered Euryclea. "  are
fifty women     house whom   teach     things, such   carding
wool,     kinds   household work.   these, twelve      
misbehaved,     been wanting   respect    ,   also   Penelope.
  showed no disrespect   Telemachus,     has only lately grown
    mother never permitted him   give orders     female servants;
but let     upstairs   tell your wife     has happened,  
some god has been sending     sleep." 

"    wake   yet," answered Ulysses, "but tell   women    
misconducted themselves   come    ." 

Euryclea left   cloister   tell   women,   make them come  
Ulysses;     meantime   called Telemachus,   stockman,    
swineherd. "Begin," said  , "  remove   dead,   make   women
help  . Then,   sponges   clean water   swill down   tables
  seats. When     thoroughly cleansed   whole cloisters,
take   women into   space between   domed room     wall
    outer court,   run them through   your swords till  
are quite dead,     forgotten     love     way    
  used   lie   secret     suitors." 

      women came down     body, weeping   wailing bitterly.
First   carried   dead bodies  ,   propped them   against
  another     gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them     made
them     work quickly,     had   carry   bodies  . When
  had done  ,   cleaned     tables   seats   sponges
  water, while Telemachus     two others shovelled     blood
  dirt     ground,     women carried     away   put
      doors. Then when   had made   whole place quite clean
  orderly,   took   women     hemmed them     narrow
space between   wall     domed room         yard,  
    could     away:   Telemachus said     other two,
"  shall   let these women die   clean death,     were insolent
        mother,   used   sleep     suitors."

  saying   made   ship   cable fast         bearing posts
  supported   roof     domed room,   secured     around
  building,     good height, lest any     women   feet should
touch   ground;     thrushes   doves beat against   net  
has been set   them     thicket just     were getting    
nest,     terrible fate awaits them, even   did   women  
  put   heads   nooses   after   other   die most miserably.
  feet moved convulsively     while, but     very long.

    Melanthius,   took him through   cloister into   inner
court.     cut off   nose     ears;   drew    
vitals   gave them     dogs raw,   then     fury  
cut off   hands     feet. 

When   had done     washed   hands   feet   went
back into   house,     was now over;   Ulysses said    
dear old nurse Euryclea, "Bring   sulphur,   cleanses   pollution,
  fetch fire also     may burn  ,   purify   cloisters.
 , moreover,   tell Penelope   come here     attendants,
  also     maid servants   are     house." 

"        said is true," answered Euryclea, "but let   bring
  some clean clothes-   shirt   cloak.     keep these rags
  your back any longer.   is   right." 

"First light     fire," replied Ulysses. 
She brought   fire   sulphur,     had bidden  ,   Ulysses
thoroughly purified   cloisters   both   inner   outer courts.
Then she went inside   call   women   tell them   had happened;
whereon   came     apartment   torches     hands,
  pressed round Ulysses   embrace him, kissing   head   shoulders
  taking hold     hands.   made him feel       should like
  weep,     remembered every     them.

BOOK XXIII

Euryclea now went upstairs laughing   tell   mistress    
dear husband had come home.   aged knees became young again  
  feet were nimble   joy   she went       mistress   bent
over   head   speak    . "Wake   Penelope,   dear child,"
she exclaimed, "  see   your own eyes something      
been wanting   long time past. Ulysses has   last indeed come
home again,   has killed   suitors   were giving   much trouble
    house, eating     estate   ill treating   son."

"  good nurse," answered Penelope, "  must   mad.   gods sometimes
send some very sensible people       minds,   make foolish
people become sensible.   is     must   been doing  
 ;     always used       reasonable person. Why should  
thus mock   when     trouble enough already- talking such nonsense,
  waking           sweet sleep   had taken possession  
  eyes   closed them?     never slept   soundly     day
  poor husband went     city     ill omened name.   back
again into   women   room;     had been any   else,   had
woke       bring   such absurd news   should   sent   away
    severe scolding.     is, your age shall protect  ."

"  dear child," answered Euryclea, "  am   mocking  .   is quite
true     tell     Ulysses is come home again.   was   stranger
whom     kept   treating   badly     cloister. Telemachus
knew     time     was come back, but kept   father   secret
    might     revenge     these wicked people.

Then Penelope sprang       couch, threw   arms round Euryclea,
  wept   joy. "But   dear nurse," said she, "explain    
 ;     has really come home      , how did   manage   overcome
  wicked suitors single handed, seeing     number   them  
always were?" 

"  was    ," answered Euryclea, "      know;   only heard
them groaning while   were being killed.   sat crouching   huddled
      corner     women   room     doors closed, till your
son came   fetch   because   father sent him. Then   found Ulysses
standing over   corpses   were lying     ground   round
him,     top     other.       enjoyed       could
  seen him standing     bespattered   blood   filth,
  looking just like   lion. But   corpses are now   piled  
    gatehouse   is     outer court,   Ulysses has lit  
great fire   purify   house   sulphur.   has sent     call
 ,   come         may both   happy together after  ;
  now   last   desire   your heart has been fulfilled; your
husband is come home   find both wife   son alive   well,  
  take   revenge     own house     suitors   behaved  
badly   him." 

"'  dear nurse," said Penelope, "    exult too confidently over
   .   know how delighted every         see Ulysses
come home- more particularly myself,     son   has been born
  both   us; but     tell   cannot   really true.   is some
god   is angry     suitors     great wickedness,  
has made   end   them;     respected no man     whole world,
neither rich nor poor,   came near them,   came near them,  
    come     bad end   consequence     iniquity. Ulysses
is dead far away     Achaean land;     never return home
again." 

Then nurse Euryclea said, "  child,   are   talking  ? but
  were   hard   belief     made   your mind   your husband
is never coming, although   is     house       own fire side
    very moment. Besides   can give   another proof; when  
was washing him   perceived   scar     wild boar gave him,
    wanted   tell      , but     wisdom      
let  ,   clapped   hands over   mouth;   come        
  make   bargain    -     am deceiving  ,   may  
  killed     most cruel death   can think  ." 

"  dear nurse," said Penelope, "however wise   may     can hardly
fathom   counsels     gods. Nevertheless,         search
    son,     may see   corpses     suitors,     man
  has killed them." 

    she came down     upper room,   while doing   she
considered whether she should keep     distance     husband
  question him,   whether she should   once       him   embrace
him. When, however, she had crossed   stone floor     cloister,
she sat down opposite Ulysses     fire, against   wall   right
angles [        she had entered], while Ulysses sat near
      bearing posts, looking upon   ground,   waiting  
see     wife       him when she saw him.     long time
she sat silent       lost   amazement.     moment she looked
him full     face, but then again directly, she was misled    
shabby clothes   failed   recognize him, till Telemachus began
  reproach     said: 

"Mother- but   are   hard     cannot call     such   name-
why     keep away     father     way? Why       sit
    side   begin talking   him   asking him questions? No
other woman could bear   keep away     husband when   had come
back     after twenty years   absence,   after having gone through
  much; but your heart always was   hard     stone." 

Penelope answered, "  son,   am   lost   astonishment     can
find no words     either   ask questions     answer them.
  cannot even look him straight     face. Still,     really is
Ulysses come back     own home again,   shall     understand
  another better      ,     are tokens       two
are alone acquainted,     are hidden     others."

Ulysses smiled    ,   said   Telemachus, "Let your mother put
    any proof she likes; she   make     mind     presently.
She rejects       moment   believes       somebody else,
because   am covered   dirt     such bad clothes  ; let us,
however, consider     had better   next. When   man has killed
another, even though   was         leave many friends  
take     quarrel,   man   has killed him must still   good
bye     friends   fly   country; whereas     been killing
  stay     whole town,       picked youth   Ithaca.    
    consider   matter." 

"Look     yourself, father," answered Telemachus, "     
  are   wisest counsellor     world,       is no other
mortal man   can compare    .     follow     right
good  , nor shall   find us fail       far   our strength
holds  ." 

"          think     best," answered Ulysses. "First wash
  put your shirts  ; tell   maids also         own room
  dress; Phemius shall then strike     dance tune     lyre,
      people outside hear,   any     neighbours,   some
  going along   street happens   notice  ,   may think  
is   wedding     house,   no rumours     death     suitors
          town, before   can escape     woods upon
  own land. Once  ,     settle       courses heaven
vouchsafes us shall seem wisest." 

Thus did   speak,     did even     had said. First   washed
  put   shirts  , while   women got ready. Then Phemius took
  lyre   set them   longing   sweet song   stately dance.
  house re echoed     sound   men   women dancing,    
people outside said, "  suppose   queen has been getting married
  last. She ought     ashamed   herself     continuing  
protect   husband   property until   comes home." 

  was     said, but   did   know     was   had
been happening.   upper servant Eurynome washed   anointed Ulysses
    own house   gave him   shirt   cloak, while Minerva made
him look taller   stronger than before; she also made   hair grow
thick     top     head,   flow down   curls like hyacinth
blossoms; she glorified him     head   shoulders just    
skilful workman   has studied art     kinds under Vulcan   Minerva-
    work is full   beauty- enriches   piece   silver plate  
gilding  .   came     bath looking like       immortals,
  sat down opposite   wife     seat   had left. "  dear,"
said  , "heaven has endowed       heart more unyielding than
woman ever yet had. No other woman could bear   keep away    
husband when   had come back     after twenty years   absence,
  after having gone through   much. But come, nurse,     bed
ready    ;     sleep alone,     woman has   heart   hard
  iron." 

"  dear," answered Penelope, "    no wish   set myself  , nor
  depreciate  ; but   am   struck   your appearance,     very
well remember   kind     man   were when   set sail   Ithaca.
Nevertheless, Euryclea, take   bed outside   bed chamber  
  himself built. Bring   bed outside   room,   put bedding
upon     fleeces, good coverlets,   blankets." 

She said     try him, but Ulysses was very angry   said, "Wife,
  am much displeased         just been saying.   has been
taking   bed     place       left  ?   must   found
    hard task, no matter how skilled   workman   was, unless some
god came   helped him   shift  .   is no man living, however
strong       prime,   could move     its place,    
is   marvellous curiosity     made     very own hands.  
was   young olive growing within   precincts     house,   full
vigour,       thick     bearing post.   built   room round
    strong walls   stone     roof   cover them,     made
  doors strong   well fitting. Then   cut off   top boughs  
  olive tree   left   stump standing.     dressed roughly
    root upwards   then worked   carpenter   tools well
  skilfully, straightening   work   drawing   line     wood,
  making   into   bed prop.   then bored   hole down   middle,
  made     centre post     bed,       worked till   had
finished  , inlaying     gold   silver; after     stretched
  hide   crimson leather     side         other.    
see   know      ,     desire   learn whether   is still
 ,   whether any   has been removing     cutting down  
olive tree   its roots." 

When she heard   sure proofs Ulysses now gave  , she fairly broke
down. She flew weeping     side, flung   arms     neck,
  kissed him. "      angry     Ulysses," she cried, " ,
  are   wisest   mankind.     suffered, both   us. Heaven
has denied us   happiness   spending our youth,     growing
old, together;     then   aggrieved   take   amiss     did
  embrace   thus   soon     saw  .     been shuddering
    time through fear   someone might come here   deceive
      lying story;     are many very wicked people going
 . Jove   daughter Helen   never   yielded herself    
man     foreign country,   she had known     sons   Achaeans
  come after     bring   back. Heaven put       heart
    wrong,   she gave no thought     sin,   has been  
source     our sorrows. Now, however,       convinced  
  showing     know     our bed (  no human being has
ever seen but           single maid servant,   daughter  
Actor,   was given       father     marriage,     keeps
  doors   our room) hard   belief though     been   can mistrust
no longer." 

Then Ulysses     turn melted,   wept     clasped   dear  
faithful wife     bosom.     sight   land is welcome   men
  are swimming towards   shore, when Neptune has wrecked  
ship     fury     winds   waves-   few alone reach   land,
  these, covered   brine, are thankful when   find themselves
  firm ground       danger- even   was   husband welcome
      she looked upon him,   she could   tear   two fair
arms       neck. Indeed       gone   indulging
  sorrow till rosy fingered morn appeared, had   Minerva determined
otherwise,   held night back     far west, while she    
suffer Dawn   leave Oceanus, nor   yoke   two steeds Lampus  
Phaethon   bear   onward   break   day upon mankind.

  last, however, Ulysses said, "Wife,       yet reached  
end   our troubles.       unknown amount   toil still   undergo.
  is long   difficult, but   must   through    ,   thus
  shade   Teiresias prophesied concerning  ,     day when  
went down into Hades   ask     return         companions.
But now let us     bed,     may lie down   enjoy   blessed
boon   sleep." 

"  shall     bed   soon     please," replied Penelope, "now
    gods   sent   home   your own good house     your
country. But   heaven has put     your mind   speak    , tell
      task   lies before  .   shall     hear  
  later,     is better     should   told   once."

"  dear," answered Ulysses, "why should   press     tell  ?
Still,       conceal      , though       like  .
      like   myself,   Teiresias bade   travel far   wide,
carrying   oar, till   came     country where   people   never
heard     sea,       even mix salt     food.   know
nothing   ships, nor oars   are     wings     ship.  
gave     certain token         hide    .   said
    wayfarer should meet     ask   whether   was   winnowing
shovel     had     shoulder.    ,   was   fix   oar  
  ground   sacrifice   ram,   bull,     boar   Neptune; after
    was     home   offer hecatombs       gods   heaven,
  after   other.     myself,   said   death should come
        sea,       life should ebb away very gently when
  was full   years   peace   mind,     people should bless
 .    ,   said, should surely come   pass." 

  Penelope said, "    gods are going   vouchsafe     happier
time   your old age,   may hope then     some respite  
misfortune." 

Thus did   converse. Meanwhile Eurynome     nurse took torches
  made   bed ready   soft coverlets;   soon     had laid
them,   nurse went back into   house         rest, leaving
  bed chamber woman Eurynome   show Ulysses   Penelope   bed
  torch light. When she had conducted them     room she went
back,     then came joyfully     rites     own old bed.
Telemachus, Philoetius,     swineherd now left off dancing,  
made   women leave off also.   then laid themselves down   sleep
    cloisters. 

When Ulysses   Penelope had had   fill   love   fell talking
    another. She told him how much she had had   bear   seeing
  house filled     crowd   wicked suitors   had killed  
many sheep   oxen     account,   had drunk   many casks  
wine. Ulysses     turn told       had suffered,   how much
trouble   had himself given   other people.   told   everything,
  she was   delighted   listen   she never went   sleep till
  had ended   whole story. 

  began     victory over   Cicons,   how   thence reached
  fertile land     Lotus eaters.   told         Cyclops
  how   had punished him   having   ruthlessly eaten   brave
comrades; how   then went     Aeolus,   received him hospitably
  furthered him     way, but even     was     reach home,
      great grief   hurricane carried him     sea again; how
  went       Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where   people destroyed
    ships     crews, save himself     own ship only.
Then   told   cunning Circe     craft,   how   sailed  
  chill house   Hades,   consult   ghost     Theban prophet
Teiresias,   how   saw   old comrades   arms,     mother
  bore him   brought him   when   was   child; how   then heard
  wondrous singing     Sirens,   went       wandering rocks
  terrible Charybdis     Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed
  safety; how   men then ate   cattle     sun god,   how
Jove therefore struck   ship     thunderbolts,      
  men perished together, himself alone being left alive; how  
last   reached   Ogygian island     nymph Calypso,   kept
him       cave,   fed him,   wanted him   marry  ,  
  case she intended making him immortal       should never
grow old, but she could   persuade him   let      ;   how
after much suffering   had found   way     Phaeacians,   had
treated him   though   had been   god,   sent him back     ship
    own country after having given him gold, bronze,   raiment
  great abundance.   was   last thing       told  ,
  here   deep sleep took hold upon him   eased   burden    
sorrows. 

Then Minerva bethought     another matter. When she deemed  
Ulysses had had both     wife     repose, she bade gold enthroned
Dawn rise     Oceanus   she might shed light upon mankind.  
 , Ulysses rose     comfortable bed   said   Penelope,
"Wife,     both   us had our full share   troubles,  , here,
  lamenting   absence,       being prevented   getting home
though   was longing     time      . Now, however,    
    last come together, take care     property   is    
house.       sheep   goats     wicked suitors   eaten,
    take many myself   force   other people,     compel
  Achaeans   make good   rest till   shall   filled  
  yards.   am now going     wooded lands       country  
see   father   has   long been grieved     account,     yourself
    give these instructions, though     little need   them.
  sunrise       once   abroad       been killing  
suitors;   upstairs, therefore,   stay     your women. See
nobody   ask no questions." 

    spoke   girded     armour. Then   roused Telemachus, Philoetius,
  Eumaeus,   told them     put     armour also.    
did,   armed themselves. When   had done  ,   opened  
gates   sallied forth, Ulysses leading   way.   was now daylight,
but Minerva nevertheless concealed them   darkness   led them quickly
      town.

BOOK XXIV

Then Mercury   Cyllene summoned   ghosts     suitors,    
  hand   held   fair golden wand       seals men   eyes
  sleep   wakes them just     pleases;       roused  
ghosts   led them, while   followed whining   gibbering behind
him.   bats fly squealing     hollow   some great cave, when
    them has fallen       cluster       hang, even
  did   ghosts whine   squeal   Mercury   healer   sorrow
led them down into   dark abode   death. When   had passed  
waters   Oceanus     rock Leucas,   came     gates    
sun     land   dreams, whereon   reached   meadow   asphodel
where dwell   souls   shadows   them   can labour no more.

Here   found   ghost   Achilles son   Peleus,   those  
Patroclus, Antilochus,   Ajax,   was   finest   handsomest
man       Danaans after   son   Peleus himself. 

  gathered round   ghost     son   Peleus,     ghost
  Agamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered
also   ghosts   those   had perished   him     house  
Aeisthus;     ghost   Achilles spoke first. 

"Son   Atreus,"   said, "  used       Jove had loved  
better   first   last than any other hero,     were captain
over many   brave men, when   were   fighting together before
Troy; yet   hand   death,   no mortal can escape, was laid
upon     too early. Better     had   fallen   Troy    
hey day   your renown,     Achaeans     built   mound
over your ashes,   your son     been heir   your good name,
whereas   has now been your lot   come     most miserable end."

"Happy son   Peleus," answered   ghost   Agamemnon, "  having
died   Troy far   Argos, while   bravest     Trojans  
  Achaeans fell round   fighting   your body.     lay
    whirling clouds   dust,   huge   hugely, heedless now
  your chivalry.   fought   whole     livelong day, nor should
  ever   left off   Jove had   sent   hurricane   stay us.
Then, when   had borne       ships       fray,   laid
    your bed   cleansed your fair skin   warm water    
ointments.   Danaans tore   hair   wept bitterly round  
 . Your mother, when she heard, came     immortal nymphs  
      sea,     sound     great wailing went forth over  
waters       Achaeans quaked   fear.       fled
panic stricken     ships had   wise old Nestor whose counsel
was ever truest checked them saying, 'Hold, Argives, fly   sons
    Achaeans,   is   mother coming     sea     immortal
nymphs   view   body     son.' 

"Thus   spoke,     Achaeans feared no more.   daughters  
  old man     sea stood round   weeping bitterly,   clothed
    immortal raiment.   nine muses also came   lifted    
sweet voices   lament- calling   answering   another;   was
    Argive but wept   pity     dirge   chaunted. Days  
nights seven   ten   mourned  , mortals   immortals, but  
  eighteenth day   gave       flames,   many   fat sheep
  many   ox did   slay   sacrifice around  .   were burnt
  raiment     gods,   rich resins     honey, while heroes,
horse   foot, clashed   armour round   pile     were burning,
    tramp       great multitude. But when   flames   heaven
had done   work,   gathered your white bones   daybreak  
laid them   ointments     pure wine. Your mother brought us  
golden vase   hold them- gift   Bacchus,   work   Vulcan himself;
      mingled your bleached bones   those   Patroclus  
had gone before  ,   separate   enclosed also those   Antilochus,
  had been closer     than any other   your comrades now  
Patroclus was no more. 

"Over these   host     Argives built   noble tomb,     point
jutting   over   open Hellespont,     might   seen   far
  upon   sea   those now living     them   shall   born
hereafter. Your mother begged prizes     gods,   offered them
    contended       noblest     Achaeans.   must  
been present     funeral   many   hero, when   young men gird
themselves   make ready   contend   prizes     death   some
great chieftain, but   never saw such prizes   silver footed Thetis
offered   your honour;     gods loved   well. Thus even  
death your fame, Achilles, has   been lost,   your name lives
evermore among   mankind. But      ,   solace had   when
  days     fighting were done?   Jove willed   destruction
    return,     hands   Aegisthus   those     wicked wife."

Thus did   converse,   presently Mercury came     them  
  ghosts     suitors   had been killed   Ulysses.   ghosts
  Agamemnon   Achilles were astonished   seeing them,   went
    them   once.   ghost   Agamemnon recognized Amphimedon son
  Melaneus,   lived   Ithaca   had been   host,     began
  talk   him. 

"Amphimedon,"   said, "  has happened       fine young men-
      age too-     are come down here under   ground?  
could pick no finer body   men   any city. Did Neptune raise  
winds   waves against   when   were   sea,   did your enemies
make   end         mainland when   were cattle lifting  
sheep stealing,   while fighting   defence     wives   city?
Answer   question,       been your guest.       remember
how   came   your house   Menelaus,   persuade Ulysses   join
us     ships against Troy?   was   whole month ere   could
resume our voyage,     had hard work   persuade Ulysses   come
  us." 

    ghost   Amphimedon answered, "Agamemnon, son   Atreus, king
  men,   remember everything       said,     tell  
fully   accurately     way     our end was brought  .
Ulysses had been long gone,     were courting   wife,   did
    point blank   she     marry, nor yet bring matters
    end,   she meant   compass our destruction:  , then, was
  trick she played us. She set     great tambour frame     room
  began   work     enormous piece   fine needlework. 'Sweethearts,'
said she, 'Ulysses is indeed dead, still,     press     marry
again immediately; wait-             skill   needlework
perish unrecorded- till     completed   pall     hero Laertes,
against   time when death shall take him.   is very rich,    
women     place   talk     is laid   without   pall.'  
is   she said,     assented; whereupon   could see   working
upon   great web   day long, but   night she   unpick  
stitches again   torchlight. She fooled us     way   three
years without our finding    , but   time wore     she was
now     fourth year,     waning   moons   many days had been
accomplished,       maids   knew   she was doing told us,
    caught       act   undoing   work,   she had   finish
  whether she     no;   when she showed us   robe she had
made, after she had had   washed, its splendour was        
sun   moon. 

"Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses     upland farm where
  swineherd lives. Thither presently came also   son, returning
    voyage   Pylos,     two came     town when   had
hatched   plot   our destruction. Telemachus came first,  
then after him, accompanied     swineherd, came Ulysses, clad  
rags   leaning     staff   though   were some miserable old beggar.
  came   unexpectedly   none   us knew him,   even   older
ones among us,     reviled him   threw things   him.   endured
both being struck   insulted without   word, though   was    
own house; but when       Aegis bearing Jove inspired him,  
  Telemachus took   armour   hid       inner chamber, bolting
  doors behind them. Then   cunningly made   wife offer   bow
    quantity   iron     contended     us ill fated suitors;
    was   beginning   our end,         us could string
  bow- nor nearly    . When   was     reach   hands  
Ulysses,       us shouted       should     given him,
no matter     might  , but Telemachus insisted     having
 . When   had got       hands   strung     ease   sent
  arrow through   iron. Then   stood     floor     cloister
  poured   arrows     ground, glaring fiercely   him. First
  killed Antinous,   then, aiming straight before him,   let fly
  deadly darts     fell thick     another.   was plain
  some       gods was helping them,     fell upon us
  might   main throughout   cloisters,     was   hideous
sound   groaning   our brains were being battered  ,     ground
seethed   our blood.  , Agamemnon, is how   came   our end,
  our bodies are lying still un cared       house   Ulysses,
  our friends   home     yet know   has happened,    
  cannot lay us     wash   black blood   our wounds, making
moan over us according     offices due     departed."

"Happy Ulysses, son   Laertes," replied   ghost   Agamemnon, " 
are indeed blessed     possession     wife endowed   such rare
excellence   understanding,     faithful     wedded lord  
Penelope   daughter   Icarius.   fame, therefore,     virtue
shall never die,     immortals shall compose   song   shall
  welcome     mankind   honour     constancy   Penelope.
How far otherwise was   wickedness     daughter   Tyndareus
  killed   lawful husband;   song shall   hateful among men,
  she has brought disgrace     womankind even     good ones."

Thus did   converse     house   Hades deep down within  
bowels     earth. Meanwhile Ulysses     others passed    
  town   soon reached   fair   well tilled farm   Laertes,
    had reclaimed   infinite labour. Here was   house,  
  lean   running   round  , where   slaves   worked   him
slept   sat   ate, while inside   house   was   old Sicel
woman,   looked after him       country farm. When Ulysses
got  ,   said     son       other two: 

"      house,   kill   best pig     can find   dinner.
Meanwhile   want   see whether   father   know  ,   fail  
recognize   after   long   absence." 

  then took off   armour   gave     Eumaeus   Philoetius,
  went straight       house, while   turned off into   vineyard
  make trial     father.     went down into   great orchard,
  did   see Dolius, nor any     sons nor     other bondsmen,
    were   gathering thorns   make   fence     vineyard,
    place where   old man had told them;   therefore found  
father alone, hoeing   vine.   had     dirty old shirt, patched
  very shabby;   legs were bound round   thongs   oxhide  
save him     brambles,     also wore sleeves   leather;  
had   goat skin cap     head,   was looking very woe begone.
When Ulysses saw him   worn,   old   full   sorrow,   stood
still under   tall pear tree   began   weep.   doubted whether
  embrace him, kiss him,   tell him       having come home,
  whether   should first question him   see        .
    end   deemed   best     crafty   him,       mind
  went       father,   was bending down   digging    
plant. 

"  see, sir," said Ulysses, "    are   excellent gardener-  
pains   take    ,     sure.   is     single plant,  
  fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears   trace
  your attention.   trust, however,           offended
          take better care   your garden than   yourself.
  are old, unsavoury,   very meanly clad.   cannot   because
  are idle   your master takes such poor care    , indeed
your face   figure   nothing     slave   them,   proclaim
    noble birth.   should   said     were     those
  should wash well, eat well,   lie soft   night   old men  
  right    ; but tell  ,   tell   true, whose bondman are  ,
    whose garden are   working? Tell   also   another matter.
Is   place       come   really Ithaca?   met   man just
now   said  , but   was   dull fellow,   had     patience
  hear   story   when   was asking him     old friend  
mine, whether   was still living,   was already dead      
house   Hades. Believe   when   tell       man came    
house once when   was     own country   never yet did any stranger
come     whom   liked better.   said     family came  
Ithaca       father was Laertes, son   Arceisius.   received
him hospitably, making him welcome       abundance     house,
  when   went away   gave him   customary presents.   gave him
seven talents   fine gold,     cup   solid silver   flowers
chased upon  .   gave him twelve light cloaks,     many pieces
  tapestry;   also gave him twelve cloaks   single fold, twelve
rugs, twelve fair mantles,     equal number   shirts.      
  added four good looking women skilled     useful arts,    
let him take   choice." 

  father shed tears   answered, "Sir,     indeed come  
  country       named, but   is fallen into   hands  
wicked people.     wealth   presents has been given   no purpose.
    could   found your friend here alive   Ithaca,    
  entertained   hospitably       required your presents
amply when   left him-       been only right considering
      already given him. But tell  ,   tell   true, how
many years is   since   entertained   guest-   unhappy son,
  ever was? Alas!   has perished far     own country;   fishes
    sea   eaten him,     has fallen   prey     birds  
wild beasts   some continent. Neither   mother, nor     father,
  were   parents, could throw our arms   him   wrap him
    shroud, nor could   excellent   richly dowered wife Penelope
bewail   husband   was natural upon   death bed,   close  
eyes according     offices due     departed. But now, tell  
truly     want   know.     whence are  - tell     your
town   parents? Where is   ship lying   has brought    
your men   Ithaca?   were     passenger   some other man   ship,
  those   brought   here   gone     way   left  ?"

"    tell   everything," answered Ulysses, "quite truly.   come
  Alybas, where       fine house.   am son   king Apheidas,
  is   son   Polypemon.   own name is Eperitus; heaven drove
  off   course     was leaving Sicania,       been carried
here against    .       ship   is lying over yonder, off
  open country outside   town,     is   fifth year since
Ulysses left   country. Poor fellow, yet   omens were good  
him when   left  .   birds   flew   our right hands,   both
      rejoiced   see them     parted,     had every hope
    should   another friendly meeting   exchange presents."

  dark cloud   sorrow fell upon Laertes     listened.   filled
both hands     dust   off   ground   poured   over  
grey head, groaning heavily     did  .   heart   Ulysses was
touched,     nostrils quivered     looked upon   father; then
  sprang towards him, flung   arms   him   kissed him, saying,
"  am  , father,   whom   are asking-     returned after
having been away   twenty years. But cease your sighing   lamentation-
    no time   lose,     should tell         been killing
  suitors     house,   punish them     insolence   crimes."

"    really are   son Ulysses," replied Laertes, "    come
back again,   must give   such manifest proof   your identity
  shall convince  ." 

"First observe   scar," answered Ulysses, "    got     boar  
tusk when   was hunting   Mount Parnassus.       mother had
sent     Autolycus,   mother   father,   receive   presents
  when   was over here   had promised   give  . Furthermore
    point         trees     vineyard     gave  ,
    asked       them     followed   round   garden.
  went over them  ,     told     names        
were.   gave   thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees,   forty
fig trees;   also said     give   fifty rows   vines;  
was corn planted between each row,     yield grapes   every
kind when   heat   heaven has been laid heavy upon them."

Laertes' strength failed him when   heard   convincing proofs  
  son had given him.   threw   arms   him,   Ulysses had
  support him,         gone off into   swoon; but   soon
    came  ,   was beginning   recover   senses,   said, " 
father Jove, then   gods are still   Olympus after  ,    
suitors   really been punished     insolence   folly. Nevertheless,
  am much afraid     shall       townspeople   Ithaca  
here directly,         sending messengers everywhere throughout
  cities     Cephallenians." 

Ulysses answered, "Take heart       trouble yourself    ,
but let us   into   house hard   your garden.     already told
Telemachus, Philoetius,   Eumaeus             dinner
ready   soon   possible." 

Thus conversing   two made   way towards   house. When  
got     found Telemachus     stockman     swineherd
cutting   meat   mixing wine   water. Then   old Sicel woman
took Laertes inside   washed him   anointed him   oil. She
put him     good cloak,   Minerva came     him   gave him  
more imposing presence, making him taller   stouter than before.
When   came back   son was surprised   see him looking   like
  immortal,   said   him, "  dear father, some       gods
has been making   much taller   better looking." 

Laertes answered, " ,   Father Jove, Minerva,   Apollo,  
  were   man   was when   ruled among   Cephallenians,   took
Nericum,   strong fortress     foreland.     were still  
  then was   had been   our house yesterday     armour  ,
  should   been able   stand       help   against   suitors.
  should   killed   great many   them,         rejoiced
  see  ." 

Thus did   converse; but   others, when   had finished  
work     feast was ready, left off working,   took each  
proper place     benches   seats. Then   began eating;  
    old Dolius     sons left   work   came  ,    
mother,   Sicel woman   looked after Laertes now     was growing
old, had been   fetch them. When   saw Ulysses   were certain
  was  ,   stood   lost   astonishment; but Ulysses scolded
them good naturedly   said, "Sit down   your dinner, old man,  
never mind   your surprise;     been wanting   begin  
some time     been waiting    ." 

Then Dolius put   both   hands   went     Ulysses. "Sir,"
said  , seizing   master   hand   kissing       wrist, " 
  long been wishing   home:   now heaven has restored    
us after   had given   hoping.   hail, therefore,   may  
gods prosper  . But tell  , does Penelope already know   your
return,   shall   send some     tell  ?" 

"Old man," answered Ulysses, "she knows already,     need   trouble
   ."       took   seat,     sons   Dolius gathered
round Ulysses   give him greeting   embrace him   after   other;
then   took   seats   due order near Dolius   father.

While   were thus busy getting   dinner ready, Rumour went
round   town,   noised abroad   terrible fate   had befallen
  suitors;   soon, therefore,     people heard       gathered
  every quarter, groaning   hooting before   house   Ulysses.
  took   dead away, buried every man   own,   put   bodies
  those   came   elsewhere   board   fishing vessels,  
  fishermen   take each   them     own place.   then met
angrily     place   assembly,   when   were got together
Eupeithes rose   speak.   was overwhelmed   grief     death
    son Antinous,   had been   first man killed   Ulysses,
    said, weeping bitterly, "  friend,   man has done   Achaeans
great wrong.   took many   our best men away   him     fleet,
    has lost both ships   men; now, moreover,     return  
has been killing     foremost men among   Cephallenians. Let
us       doing before   can   away   Pylos     Elis where
  Epeans rule,     shall   ashamed   ourselves   ever afterwards.
        everlasting disgrace   us         avenge   murder
  our sons   brothers.     own part   should   no mote pleasure
  life, but had rather die   once. Let us    , then,   after
them, before   can cross over     mainland." 

  wept     spoke   every   pitied him. But Medon     bard
Phemius had now woke  ,   came   them     house   Ulysses.
Every   was astonished   seeing them, but   stood     middle
    assembly,   Medon said, "Hear  , men   Ithaca. Ulysses
did     these things against       heaven.   myself saw  
immortal god take   form   Mentor   stand beside him.   god
appeared, now   front   him encouraging him,   now going furiously
    court   attacking   suitors whereon   fell thick
    another." 

    pale fear laid hold   them,   old Halitherses, son   Mastor,
rose   speak,     was   only man among them   knew both past
  future;     spoke   them plainly       honesty, saying,

"Men   Ithaca,   is   your own fault   things   turned  
     ;       listen    , nor yet   Mentor, when
  bade   check   folly   your sons   were doing much wrong
    wantonness     hearts- wasting   substance   dishonouring
  wife     chieftain     thought     return. Now, however,
let          ,         tell  .         against Ulysses,
    may find       been drawing down evil   your own heads."

  was     said,   more than half raised   loud shout,  
  once left   assembly. But   rest stayed where   were,  
  speech   Halitherses displeased them,     sided   Eupeithes;
  therefore hurried off     armour,   when   had armed
themselves,   met together   front     city,   Eupeithes
led them       folly.   thought   was going   avenge  
murder     son, whereas   truth   was never   return, but was
himself   perish     attempt. 

Then Minerva said   Jove, "Father, son   Saturn, king   kings,
answer     question-       propose    ?     set them
fighting still further,       make peace between them?"

  Jove answered, "  child, why should   ask  ? Was      
your own arrangement   Ulysses came home   took   revenge upon
  suitors?   whatever   like, but     tell       think
    most reasonable arrangement. Now   Ulysses is revenged,
let them swear     solemn covenant,   virtue       shall continue
  rule, while   cause   others   forgive   forget   massacre
    sons   brothers. Let them then   become friends   heretofore,
  let peace   plenty reign." 

  was   Minerva was already eager   bring  ,   down she
darted   off   topmost summits   Olympus. 

Now when Laertes     others had done dinner, Ulysses began  
saying, "Some           see     are   getting close
    us."       Dolius   sons went     was bid. Standing  
  threshold   could see them   quite near,   said   Ulysses,
"Here   are, let us put   our armour   once." 

  put     armour   fast     could-   is     Ulysses,
  three men,     six sons   Dolius. Laertes also   Dolius
did   same- warriors   necessity   spite     grey hair. When
  had   put     armour,   opened   gate   sallied
forth, Ulysses leading   way. 

Then Jove   daughter Minerva came     them, having assumed   form
  voice   Mentor. Ulysses was glad when   saw  ,   said  
  son Telemachus, "Telemachus, now   are     fight    
engagement,     show every man   mettle,   sure     disgrace
your ancestors,   were eminent     strength   courage  
  world over." 

"    truly,   dear father," answered Telemachus, "    shall
see,      ,     am   no mind   disgrace your family."

Laertes was delighted when   heard  . "Good heavens,   exclaimed,
"    day   am enjoying:     indeed rejoice    .   son   grandson
are vying     another     matter   valour." 

    Minerva came close     him   said, "Son   Arceisius-
best friend         world- pray     blue eyed damsel,  
  Jove   father; then poise your spear   hurl  ." 

  she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him,   when   had prayed
      poised   spear   hurled  .   hit Eupeithes' helmet,
    spear went right through  ,     helmet stayed    ,
    armour rang rattling round him     fell heavily     ground.
Meantime Ulysses     son fell   front line     foe   smote
them     swords   spears; indeed,       killed
every     them,   prevented them   ever getting home again,
only Minerva raised   voice aloud,   made every   pause. "Men
  Ithaca," she cried, cease   dreadful war,   settle   matter
  once without further bloodshed." 

    pale fear seized every  ;   were   frightened    
arms dropped     hands   fell upon   ground     sound
    goddess   voice,     fled back     city     lives.
But Ulysses gave   great cry,   gathering himself together swooped
down like   soaring eagle. Then   son   Saturn sent   thunderbolt
  fire   fell just   front   Minerva,   she said   Ulysses,
"Ulysses, noble son   Laertes, stop   warful strife,   Jove  
  angry    ." 

Thus spoke Minerva,   Ulysses obeyed   gladly. Then Minerva assumed
  form   voice   Mentor,   presently made   covenant   peace
between   two contending parties. 

THE END
